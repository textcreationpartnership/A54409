            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The attempt, I confeſs, admits no Apologie but this, that it was fit that Poſterity, when they read His Works (for they ſhall continue while theſe Iſlands are inhabited, to upbraid Time, and reproach Marble Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of weakneſs) ſhould alſo be told that His Actions were as Heroick as His Writings, and His Life more Elegant than His Style.

            <head>THE LIFE OF Charles I.</head>
            <p>CHARLES I. King of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> was the Son of <hi>James</hi> VI. King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife a Daughter of <hi>Denmark.</hi> By His Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to him all the Rights (together with their blood) of all our Ancient both <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings to this Empire. For the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Siſter and ſole Heir of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Atheling</hi> the laſt ſurviving Prince of the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> being married to <hi>Malcolme Conmor</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> conveyed to his Line the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. married to <hi>James</hi> IV. did bring the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Titles and Blood. From this Imperial
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35342:8"/>Extract He received not more Honour than He gave to it. For the blood that was derived to Him elaborated through ſo many Royal veins, He delivered to Poſterity more maturated for Glory, and by a conſtant practice of Goodneſs more habituated for Vertue.</p>
            <p>He was born at <hi>Dunfermeling,</hi> one of the principal Towns of <hi>Fife</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> on <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 19. [<hi>Anno</hi> 1600.] in ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that His Baptiſm was haſtened without the uſual Ceremonies wherewith ſuch Royal Infants are admitted into the Church. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeeming to conſecrate Him to Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the Womb, and to accuſtom Him to the exchange of the ſtrictures of Greatneſs for clouds of Tears.</p>
            <p>There was no obſervation nor augury made at His Birth concerning the ſequel of His Life or courſe of Fortune (which are uſually related of ſuch whoſe lives have different occurrences from thoſe in others of the ſame ſtate.) Either the fear of His Death made thoſe about Him leſs obſervant of any Circumſtances which curious minds would have formed into a Prediction, He appearing like a Star that riſes ſo near the point of his ſetting, that it was thought there would be no time for calculation.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35342:8"/>Or He being at diſtance by His Birth from the Succeſſion to the Crown (Prince <hi>Henry</hi> then having the firſt hopes) made men leſs ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to enquire of His future ſtate, on whom, being born to a private Condition, the Fate of the Kingdom did not depend.</p>
            <p>But in the third year of His Age, when King <hi>James</hi> was preparing himſelf to remove to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, a certain <hi>Laird</hi> of the <hi>Highlands,</hi> though of very great age, came to the Court to take his leave of him, whom he found accompanied with all his Children. After his addreſs full of affectionate and ſage Advice (to which his gray hairs gave autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) to the King; his next application was to Duke <hi>CHARLES</hi> [<hi>Anno</hi> 1602.] (for in the ſecond year of His Age He was created Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and Baron of <hi>Ardmanock</hi>) whoſe hands he kiſs'd with ſo great an ardencie of affection, that he ſeemed forgetful of a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The King, to correct his ſuppoſed miſtake, adviſed him to a more preſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> as the Heir of his Crown, of whom he had taken little notice. The old Laird anſwered that he knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough what he did, and that <hi>It was this Child</hi> (who was then in His Nurſes arms) <hi>who ſhould convey his name and memory to the ſucceeding ages.</hi> This then was conceived dotage; but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35342:9"/>the event gave it the credit of a Prophecie, and confirmed that opinion, <hi>That ſome long-experienced ſouls in the world, before their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodging, arrive to the height of prophetick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1603.] When he was three years old He was committed to the Care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance of Sir <hi>Robert Cary</hi>'s Lady, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for being the firſt Meſſenger of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s death, whoſe long life had worn the expectation of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nobility into a ſuſpicion, <hi>that the Lords of</hi> England <hi>would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acknowledge her to be dead, as long as there was any old Woman of that Nation that could wear good cloaths, and perſonate the Majeſty of a Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1604.] In the fourth year, after He had wreſtled with a Feaver, He was brought in <hi>October</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court at <hi>Windſor,</hi> where on <hi>January</hi> 6. following, having the day before been made Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> He was inveſted with the title of <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and in the ſixth year [<hi>Anno</hi> 1606] was committed to the Pedagogy of Mr. <hi>Thomas Murray,</hi> a perſon well qualified to that Office, though a favourer of Presbytery.</p>
            <p>Under this Tutor, and confined to a reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs by the preſent weakneſs of His body,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35342:9"/>He was ſo diligent and ſtudious, that He far advanced in all that kind of Learning which is neceſſary for a Prince, <hi>without which even their natural Endowments ſeem rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant in deſpight of the ſplendour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> their fortune.</hi> His proficiency in Letters was ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> taking notice of it, to put a jeſt upon Him, one day put the Cap of the Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> (who was then, with the Prince and the Duke and other of the Nobility, waiting in the Privy Chamber for the King's coming out) on his Brothers head; adding, that <hi>If he continued a good Boy, and followed His Book, he would make Him one day Archbiſhop of Canterbury.</hi> Which the Child took in ſuch diſdain, that He threw the Cap on the ground, and trampled it under His feet with ſo much eagerneſs, that he could hardly be reſtrained. Which Paſſion was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards taken by ſome overcurious as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the ruine of Epiſcopacy by his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But the event ſhewed it was not omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to the Order, but to the Perſon of the Archbiſhop, whom in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Reign He ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the adminiſtration of His Office.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1611] In His eleventh year He was made Knight of the Garter: and in the twelfth Prince <hi>Henry</hi> dying <hi>November</hi> 6. [1612.] He ſucceeded him in the Dukedom of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and the Regalities thereof; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35342:10"/>attended his Funeral as chief Mourner, on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>On the 14. of <hi>February</hi> following He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Office of Brideman to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Elizabeth</hi> His Siſter, who on that day was married to <hi>Frederick</hi> V. Prince <hi>Elector Palatine;</hi> the gayeties of which day were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards attended with many fatal Cares and Expences.</p>
            <p>His Childhood was blemiſhed with a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Obſtinacy: for the weakneſs of His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy inclining Him to retirements, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of His ſpeech rendring diſcourſe tedious and unpleaſant, He was ſuſpected to be ſomewhat perverſe. But more age and ſtrength fitting Him for manlike Exerciſes, and the Publick hopes inviting him from His Privacies, He delivered the World of ſuch fears: for applying himſelf to action, He grew ſo perfect in Vaulting, riding the great Horſe, running at the Ring, ſhooting in Croſs-bows, Muskets, and ſometimes in great Pieces of Ordnance, that if Principality had been to be the reward of Excellency in thoſe Arts, He would have had a Title to the Crown this way alſo; being thought the beſt Marks-man and moſt graceful Manager of the great Horſe in the three Kingdoms. His te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious humor he left with his retirements,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35342:10"/>none being more deſirous of good counſel, nor any more obſequious when He found it; yea, too diſtruſtful of His own Judgment, which the iſſue of things proved always beſt when it was followed.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1616.] When he was ſixteen years old, on <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. He was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Flint,</hi> the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues thereof being aſſigned to maintain His Court which was then formed for Him. And being thus advanced in Years and State, it was expected that He ſhould no longer retain the Modeſty which the ſhades of His Privacy had accuſtomed Him unto, but now appear as the immediate Inſtrument of Empire, and that by Him the Favours and Honours of the Court ſhould be derived to others. But though Providence had changed all about, yet it had changed nothing within Him; and He thought it glory enough to be great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diminution of others; for he ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Miniſtry of State to His Fathers Favourites: which gave occaſion of diſcourſe to the <hi>Speculativi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Some thought He did it to avoid the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of the Old King, (which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have been ſomewhat raiſed by the popularity of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> whoſe breaſt was full of forward Hopes) For <hi>Young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35342:11"/>are deemed of an impatient Ambition, and old ones to be too nice and tender of their Power; in which though they are contented with a Succeſſor (as they muſt have) yet are afraid of a Partner.</hi> And it was ſuppoſed that therefore K. <hi>James</hi> had raiſed <hi>Car</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> like Comets to dim the luſtre of theſe riſing Stars. But theſe were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in the nature of the King, who was enclined to contract a private friendſhip,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> and was prodigal to the objects of it, before ever he had Sons to diver his Love, or raiſe his Fears.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Some that at a diſtance looked upon the Prince's actions, aſcribed them to a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of Mind, and an Incapacity of Greatneſs: while others, better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the frame of His Spirit, knew His prudent Modeſty inclined Him to learn the Methods of Commanding by the practice of Obedience; and that being of a peaceful Soul, He affected not to embroil the Court (and from thence the Kingdom) in Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (the effects of impotent minds) which He knew were dangerous to a State, and deſtructive to that Prince who gives birth unto them; that therefore He choſe to wait for a certain, though delayed, Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, rather than by the Compendious way
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35342:11"/>of Contraſts get a precocious Power, and leave too pregnant an Example of Ruine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Others conceived it the Prudence of the Father (with which the Son complied) who knew the true uſe of Favourites was to make them the objects of the People's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, the ſinks to receive the curſes and anger of the Vulgar, the hatred of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous, and the envy of unſatisfied ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which He would rather have fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Servants, that his Son might aſcend the Throne free and unburthened with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of any. This was the rather believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe He could diſpenſe Honours where and when He pleaſed; as he did to ſome of His own Houſhold; as Sir <hi>Robert Cary</hi> was made Lord <hi>Cary</hi> of <hi>Lepington,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Viſcount <hi>Andover,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Vaughan</hi> Lord of <hi>Molingar</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1618.] The evenneſs of His Spirit was diſcovered in the loſs of his Mother, whoſe death (preſaged, as ſome thought, by that notorious Comet which appeared <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> 18. before) happened on <hi>March</hi> 2. <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. which he bewailed with a juſt meaſure of Grief, without any affected Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, though She was moſt affectionate to Him above all her other Children; and at her Funeral He would be chief Mourner.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:35342:12"/>
            <p> The Death of the Queeu was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter followed with a ſharp Sickneſs of the King: wherein his Life ſeeming in danger, the conſequences of his Death began to be lamented. <q>Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> bewailed <hi>the ſad condition fo the Church, if God ſhould at that time determine the days of the King. The Prince being then only converſant with</hi> Scotch-<hi>men, which made up the greateſt part of his Family, and were ill-affected to the Government and Worſhip of the Church of</hi> England.</q> Of this the King became ſo ſenſible, that he made a Vow, <hi>
                  <q>If God ſhould pleaſe to reſtore his health, he would ſo inſtruct the Prince in the Controverſies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</q> as ſhould ſecure His affections to the preſent establiſhment.</hi> Which he did with ſo much ſucceſs, as he aſſured the Chaplains who were to wait on the Prince in <hi>Spain,</hi> that He was able to moderate in any emergent diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations (which yet he charged them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, if poſſible.) At which they ſmiling, he earneſtly added, <q>That CHARLES <hi>ſhould manage a point in Controverſie with the beſt-ſtudied Divine of them all.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1619.] In his 19. Year, on <hi>March</hi> 24. which was he Anniverſary of King <hi>James</hi>'s coming to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> He performed a Juſting at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> together
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35342:12"/>with ſeveral of the Nobility, wherein He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted Himſelf with a Bravery equal to His Dignity. And on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Father to the Sermon at St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, and to the Service in the Quire, He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much humble Devotion there, as he had manifeſted Princely Gallantry in his Juſts, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and applauded by the People for His accompliſhments in the Arts both of War and Peace: That he could behave Himſelf hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly towards his God, and bravely towards His Enemy; pleaſed with the hardineſs of His Body, and raviſhed with His more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Mind; that the pleaſures of the Court had not ſoftned one to sloth, nor the ſupream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fortune debauched the other to Impiety.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1622.] Confident in theſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidences of a wiſe conduct, the King (without acquainting his Council) ſends the Prince into <hi>Spain,</hi> there to contract a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and as a part of the Portion, to recover the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which His Siſters Huſband had loſt, and was by the <hi>Emperour</hi> canteld to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> And herein He was to combae all the Artiſts of State in that Court, the practices of tha Church, and put an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to that Treaty wherein the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> though much converſant in the Intrigues of that Council, had been long cajoled.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35342:13"/>
            <p> To that place He was to paſs <hi>Incognito,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied only with the Marqueſs of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Endymion Porter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Cottington,</hi> through <hi>France,</hi> where, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie His Curio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, and ſhew Himſelf to Love, He attempted and enjoyed a view of the Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> and there received the firſt Impreſſion of that Excellent <hi>Princeſs</hi> who was by Heaven deſtined to His chaſt embraces. Satisfied with that ſight, no leſſer enjoyments of any pleaſure in that great Kingdom, nor Vanity of Youth, which is hardly curbed when it is allyed to power, could tempt His ſtay, or a diſcovery of His Greatneſs; but with a ſpeed anſwerable to an active bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mind, He out-ſtripped the <hi>French</hi> Poſts which were ſent to ſtop Him, although that King had intelligence of His being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Dominions immediately after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The certain news of His ſafe arrival at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> drew after Him from hene a Princely Train, and raiſed the Cenſures of the World upon the King; <q>As being too forgetful of the Inhoſpitality of Princes to each other, who, when either Deſign, Tempeſts or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have driven their Rivals in Majeſty upon their Coaſts without a Caution, they let them not part without ſome tribute to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35342:13"/>their Intereſt: and a freſh example of this was in the King's own Mother, who ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuge in <hi>England</hi> with her Siſter Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from a Storm at home, did loſe both her Liberty and Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This none daring to mind the King of, his Jeſter <hi>Archee</hi> made him ſenſible, by telling him, <hi>He came to change Caps with him. Why,</hi> ſaid the King? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (replied <hi>Archee</hi>) <hi>Thou haſt ſent the Prince into</hi> Spain, <hi>from whence He is never like to return. But</hi> (ſaid the King) <hi>what wilt thou ſay when thou ſeeſt Him come back again? Marry,</hi> ſays the Jeſter, <hi>I will take off the Fools Cap which I now put upon thy Head for ſending Him tither, and put it on the King of</hi> Spain<hi>'s for letting Him return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſo awakened the King's apprehenſion of the Prince's danger, that it drove him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an exceeding Melancholy, from which he was never free till he was aſſured of the Prince's return to his own Dominions, which was his Fleet in the Sea: and that was not long after. For notwithſtanding the contraſts of his two prime Miniſters there, <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> (which were ſufficient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze an ordinary prudence, and diſturb the counſels of ſo young a beginning in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Empire, and the Arts of experienced Conclaves;) the impetuous attempts of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35342:14"/>
               <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Clergy, either for a Change of His Religion, or a Toleration of theirs; the Spleen of <hi>Olivares,</hi> whom <hi>Buckingham</hi> had exſaperated; He ſo dexterouſly managed the Treaty of Marriage, that all the Articles and Circumſtances were ſolemnly ſworn to by both Kings. By a Civil Letter to the Pope (which His Enemies Malice afterwards took as an occaſion of Slander) He procured a civil return, with the grant of a Diſpenſation; baffled the hopes of their Clergy by His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in his own Profeſſion, and vindicated it from the odious aſperſions of their Prieſts, by cauſing our Liturgie to be tranſlated into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue; and by His generous miene enthralled the <hi>Infanta,</hi> for whom He had expoſed His Liberty.</p>
            <p>Yet having an inſight into the practices of that Court, that they would not put the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> into the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Portion, but reſerve it as a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoetation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Love, and as an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for the <hi>Infanta</hi> to reconcile the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits, who were heated by the late Wars into an hatred of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that this was but to lengthen out the Treaty till they had wholly brought the <hi>Palatinate</hi> under their power; He conformed His mind to the reſolves of His Father, who ſaid, <hi>he would never marry his Son with a Portion of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35342:14"/>His only Siſters Tears,</hi> and therefore inclined to a rupture. But concealing His Purpoſe, and diſſembling His Knowledge of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, He conſulted His own Safety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which his Fathers Letters commanded: which he ſo prudently acquired, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> parted from Him with all thoſe endearments with which departing Friends ceremoniate their Farewels; having ſatisfied Him by a Proxie left with the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to be delivered when the Diſpenſation was come. Which as ſoon as He was ſafe on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, by a private expreſs he commanded him to keep in his hands till further Order.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1623.] His Return to <hi>England,</hi> which was in <hi>October</hi> 1623. was entertain'd with ſo much Joy and Thankſgiving, as if He had been the happy <hi>Genius</hi> of the whole Nation; and His entrance into <hi>London</hi> was as a Triumph for His Wiſdom, their Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires lengthened out the day, and their Bells by unceſſant ringing forbad ſleep to thoſe eyes which were refreſhed with His ſight. Nor could the People by age or ſickneſs he confined at home, but deſpiſing the preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Phyſicians, went to meet Him as reſtored Health.</p>
            <p>When He had given the King an account of His Voyage, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſels not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35342:15"/>to reſtore the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi> was Summoned, which was ſo zealous of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Prince, that both Houſes Voted an Addreſs to his Majeſty, that he would no longer Treat, but begin a War with <hi>Spain;</hi> and deſiring the Prince's Mediation (who was always ready to gratifie the Nation) therein to His Father, they aſſured Him they would ſtand by Him with their Lives and Fortunes: but yet when the War, with the Crown, deſcended unto him, they ſhamefully deſerted Him in the beginning of His Reign.</p>
            <p>When neither a Wiſe nor Peace was any longer to be expected from <hi>Spain,</hi> both were ſought for from <hi>France,</hi> by a Marriage with <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> the youngeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. The Love of whom the Prince had received by the Eye, and She of Him by the Ear. For having formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived impreſſions from the Relations of His Gallantry; when She was told of His paſſing through <hi>Paris,</hi> She anſwered (as it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) That <hi>if he went to</hi> Spain <hi>for a Wife, He might have had one nearer hand, and ſaved Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a great part of the labour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1625.] In the midſt of theſe Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for War and Love, King <hi>James</hi> died at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> Sunday <hi>March</hi> 27. <hi>Anno</hi> 1625. and Prince <hi>CHARLES</hi> was immediately
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35342:15"/>proclaimed at the Court-Gate <hi>King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,</hi> and ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Three Kingdoms, with infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings. The People expecting all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the happieſt Government under Him, whoſe private and youthful part of Life had been ſo ſpent, that it had nothing in it to be excuſed, and where the eager in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors for matter of Reproach met with no ſatisfaction. An Argument of a ſolid Virtue, that could hold out againſt all the <hi>Vices</hi> of <hi>Youth, that are rendred more impetuous by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Plenty, which are continually reſident in great Courts.</hi> For had any debauchery polluted His earlier days, it had been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who in ſcarcity of juſt Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did invent unimaginable Calumnies. Nor could it have been hid, for <hi>in a great Fortune nothing is concealed, but Curioſity opens the Cloſets and Bed-chambers, eſpecially of Princes, and diſcovers their cloſeſt retirements, expoſing all their actions to Fame and Cenſure.</hi> Nor did the King deceive their hopes, they being the happieſt People under the Sun while He was undiſturbed in the adminiſtration of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>His firſt publick Act was the Celebrating His Fathers Funeral, wherea He Himſelf was Chief Mourner, (contrary to the Practice of His Royal Predeceſſors, and not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35342:16"/>to the Ceremonies of State;) Either preferring Piety to an unnatural Grandeur; or urged by ſome ſecret Decree of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that in all the ruines of His Family He ſhould drink the greateſt draught of Tears; or His Spirit preſaging the Troubles of the Throne, He would hallow the Aſcent to it by a pious act of Grief.</p>
            <p>When He had pay'd that debt to His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Father, He next provided for poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and therefore haſtened the coming over of his deareſt Conſort, whom the Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> had in His Name eſpouſed at the Church of <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> and He receiving Her at <hi>Dover</hi> the next day after <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>-Sunday; at <hi>Canterbury</hi> began His Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Embraces. A Lady of moſt excellent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, who aſſumed to Her ſelf nothing in His Good Fortune but the Joy; and in His Evil bore an equal ſhare, for She reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Him, not His Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus having diſpatched the affairs of His Family, He applies Himſelf to thoſe of His Kingdoms, which too much Felicity had made unmanageable by a moderate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And He ſeemed not ſo much to aſcend a Throne, as enter upon a Theatre, to wreſtle with all the difficulties of a corrupted State; whoſe long Peace had ſoftned almoſt all the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35342:16"/>Nobleſs into Court pleaſures, and made the Commons inſolent by a great plenty. The Rites and Diſcipline of Religion had been blotted out by a long and uninterrupted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and Factions crept from the Church into the Senate, which were made uſe of by thoſe that endeavoured the alteration of Go\vernment; and the Reſolves of that Council were the dictates of ſome heady Demagogues, who fed the Vulgar with hopes of Novelty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Liberty, ſo that the King could not endure their Vices, nor they His Vertues: whence came all the Obſtructions to His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for Glory and the Publick Good. The Treaſury had been exhauſted to ſatiate the unquiet and greedy <hi>Scots:</hi> and the People were taught not to ſupply it, unleſs they were bribed with the blood of ſome Miniſter of State, or ſome more advantages fo Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Each of theſe ſingle would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled the Care of an Ordinary Prudence to have weathered out:but when all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the traiterous Projects of men of unbounded and unlawful hopes, they took from Him His Peace, and that which the World calls Happineſs; but yet they made Him Great, and affording Exerciſes for His moſt excellent Abilities rendred Him Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>The different ſtates of theſe Difficulties,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35342:17"/>when like Clouds they were gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when they deſcended in ſhowres of Blood, divide the King's Reign into two parts. The firſt could not be eſteemed days of Peace, but an Immunity from Civil War. The other was when He was concluded by that Fatal Neceſſity, either to part with his Dignity, and expoſe His Subjects to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of numerous Tyrants; or elſe to exceed the calmer temper of His peaceful Soul, and make uſe of thoſe neceſſary Arms, whereby He might hope to divert, if poſſible, the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of Church and State which he ſaw in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Part He had no Wars at home but what was in the Houſes of Parliament; which though their firſt Inſtitution deſigned for the production of juſt Counſels, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances of Government, yet, through the juſt Indignation of Heaven, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſome unquiet and ſeditious perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the wombs wherein were firſt conceived and formed thoſe monſtrous Confuſions which deſtroyed their own Liberty, cauſed our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and the King's Afflictions.</p>
            <p>His firſt Parliament began <hi>June</hi> 18. At the opening of which the <hi>King</hi> acquainted them with the neceſſity of Supplies for the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which they importunately had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35342:17"/>through His Mediation engaged His Father in, and made it as hereditary to him as the Crown. His Eloquence gave powerful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſpeedy and large ſumms of Money; did alſo audit to them the ſeveral disburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments relating both to the Army and Navy, that He might remove all Jealouſies of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imployment, and give them notice how well He underſtood the Office He had newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon, and how to be a faithful Steward of the Publick Treaſure. But the Project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the alteration of Government brought into Debate two Petitions, one for Religion, the other for Grievances, formed in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, which delayed the Succours, and increaſed the Neceſſities, which at laſt they anſwered but with two Subſidies, too poor a ſtock o furniſh an Army with; yet was kindly accepted, in expectation of more at the next Seſſion. For the Infection ſeizing upon <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament was adjourned till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when they were to meet at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> and at that time He paſſed ſuch Acts as were preſented to Him.</p>
            <p>At the next Seſſion He gave a complying and ſatisfactory anſwer to all their Petitions, and expected a Retribution in larger Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies towards the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War. But inſtead of theſe, there were high and furious debates of Grievances, conſultations to form and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35342:18"/>publiſh Remonſtrances, Accuſations of the <hi>Duke of Buckingham:</hi> Which the King eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as reproaches of His Government, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults upon Monarchy, diſſolves that Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hoping to find one of a leſs cholerick complexion after His Coronation.</p>
            <p>This inauſpicious Meeting drew after it another Miſchief, the Miſcarriage of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon <hi>Spain.</hi> For the ſupplies of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney being ſcanty and ſlow, the Fleet could not go out till <hi>October</hi> 8. an unſeaſonable time in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas; and their firſt conteſt was with Winds and Tempeſts, which deſtroying ſome, ſcattered all the Ships. When they met, a more dangerous ſtorm fell among the Soldiers and Seamen, where ſmall Pay cauſed leſs Diſcipline, and a contempt of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Lord <hi>Wimbleton,</hi> rendred th at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon <hi>Cades</hi> vain and fruitleſs. This was followed by a Contagion (to which ſome conceive diſcontented minds make the bodies of men more obnoxious) in the Navy, which forced it home, more empty of Men, and leſs of Reputation.</p>
            <p>The Infection decreaſing at <hi>London,</hi> the King performed the Solemnities of His Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation <hi>February</hi> 2. with ſome alterations from thoſe of His Predeceſſors: for in the Civil He omitted the uſual Parade of Riding
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35342:18"/>from the <hi>Tower</hi> through the City to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to ſave the Expences that Pomp requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for more noble undertakings. In the Spiritual there was reſtored a Clauſe in the Prayers which had been preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſince <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and was this; <hi>Let Him obtain favour for this People, like</hi> Aaron <hi>in the Tabernacle,</hi> Eliſha <hi>in the Waters,</hi> Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias <hi>in the Temple; give Him</hi> Peter<hi>'s Key of Diſcipline,</hi> Paul<hi>'s Doctrine.</hi> Which though more agreeing to the Principles of <hi>Proteſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,</hi> which acknowledgeth the Power of Princes in their Churches, and was therefore omitted in the times of Popery; yet was quarreled at by the Factious party, (who take advantages of Calumny and Sedition from good as well as bad circumſtances) and condemned as a new invention of Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and made uſe of to defame both the King and him.</p>
            <p>After this He began a ſecond Parliament <hi>February</hi> 2. wherein the Commons voted Him Four Subſidies, but the Demagogues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them as the price of the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>'s blood; whom Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> with ſo much bitterneſs inveighed agianſt, as paſſing the modeſty of their former diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation they taxed the King's Government. Sir <hi>Dudley Digges,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi> and others carried up Articles againſt him to the Lord's
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35342:19"/>Houſe, in which, to make the Faction more ſport, the Duke and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> did mutually impeach each other. By theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſts the Parliament were ſo highly heated, that the Faction though it fit time to put a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> in the forge, which according to their manner was to be a publick Invective againſt the Government. But the <hi>King</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of it, diſſolves the Parliament <hi>June</hi> 18. [<hi>Anno</hi> 1626.] and the Bill for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies never paſſed.</p>
            <p>This miſunderſtanding at home produced another War abroad. For the King of <hi>France</hi> taking advantage of theſe our Domeſtick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broilments begins a War upon us, and ſeiſeth upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant Ships in the River of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> His pretence was, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> had ſent back all the <hi>French</hi> Servants of the Queen, whoſe inſolencies had been into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. But the world ſaw the vanity of this pretext in the Example of <hi>Lewis</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who had in the like manner dimitted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> attendants of his own Queen: and that truly the unhappy Counſels in Parliament had expoſed this Juſt Prince to foreign inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Which He magnanimouſly endeavoured to revenge, and to recover the goods of His abuſed Subjects; and therefore ſent the Fleet deſigned for Juſtice upon <hi>Spain</hi> to ſeek it firſt in <hi>France.</hi> But the want of Money made the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35342:19"/>Preparations ſlow; and therefore the Navy putting out late in the year was by Storms forced to deſiſt the enterprize. So that what was the effect only of the malice of His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, was imputed by ſome to a ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Heaven, which obſtructed His juſt undertakings for Glory.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1627.] The next year the <hi>King,</hi> quickened by he Petitions of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who now ſued for His Protection, as well as by the Juſtice of His own Cauſe, more early proſecuted His Counſels, and ſent the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to attach the Iſle of <hi>Rhee;</hi> which though alarmed to a greater ſtrength by the laſt year's vain attempt, yet had now ſubmitted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, had not the Duke managed that War more with the Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of a Courtier than the Arts of a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And when it wa wiſdom to forſake thoſe attempts which former neglects had made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, being too greedy of Honour, and to avoid the imputation of fear in a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, he loaded his overthrow with a new Ignominy, and an heavier loſs of men, (the common fate of thoſe <hi>Who ſeek for glory in the parcels, loſe it in the groſs.</hi>) Which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the temper of his Maſter, who was ſo tender of humane blood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> therefore He raiſed no Wars, but found them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and thought it <hi>an opprobrious bargain to purchaſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35342:20"/>the fruitleſs Laurels, or the empty name of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with the lives of men, but where the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Safety required the hazzard and loſs of ſome particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Expedition beging ſo unhappy, and the Miſeries of <hi>Rochel</hi> making them importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for the <hi>King</hi>'s Aſſiſtance, His Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Soul was deſirous to emove their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but was reſtrained by that neceſſitous condition the Faction had concluded Him under. To free Himſelf from which, but He might deliver the oppreſſed, He doth pawn His own Lands for 100000 pounds to the <hi>City,</hi> and borrows 30000 pounds more of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company: but this was yet too narrow a Foundation to ſupport the charges of the Fleet, and no way ſo natural to get adequate ſupplies as by a Parliament; which He therefore ſummons to meet <hi>March</hi> 17. intending to uſe all Methods of Complacency to unite the Subjects Affections to Himſelf.</p>
            <p>Which in the beginning proved ſucceſsful, for the modeſty of the Subjects ſtrove with the Piety of the <hi>King,</hi> and both Intereſts contended to oblige, that they might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged. The Parliament granted the <hi>King</hi> [<hi>Anno</hi> 1628.] five Subſidies, and He freely granted their Petition of Right, the greateſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35342:20"/>Condeſcenſion that ever any <hi>King</hi> made, wherein He ſeemed to ſubmit the Royal Scepter to the Popular <hi>Faſces,</hi> and to have given Satisfaction even to Supererogation.</p>
            <p>Theſe auſpicious beginnings, though full of Joy both to Prince and People, were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of envy to the Faction; and therefore to form new Diſcontents and Jealouſies, the Demagogues perſwaded the Houſes that the <hi>King</hi>'s Grant of their Petition extended, (beyond their own Hopes and the Limits themſelves had ſet, and what he had expreſly mentioned and cautioned) even to the taking away His Right to <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they were again hammering a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance</hi> to reproach Him and His Miniſters of male-adminiſtration. Which Ingratitude He being not able to endure, on <hi>June</hi> 26. adjourns the Parliament till <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by Proclamation till <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. following.</p>
            <p>In the interim, the <hi>King</hi> haſtens to ſend ſuccours to <hi>Rochel:</hi> and though the General, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Aſſaſſinated by <hi>Felton,</hi> armed (as he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) with the publick hatred; yet the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were not ſlackned, the <hi>King</hi> by His perſonal induſtry doing more to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary furniſhing of the Fleet in ten or twelve days than the Duke had done in ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35342:21"/>many months before. But in the mean while <hi>Rochel</hi> was barricadoed to an impoſſibility of Relief. Therefore the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> who commanded the Forces, after ſome gallant, yet fruitleſs attempts returned to <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to the Obedience of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>As Providence had removed the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Popular hate, and (as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) the chief obſtruction of the Subjects Love to their <hi>King,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> ſo the <hi>King</hi> himſelf labours to remove all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions of quarrel before the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He reſtores Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> who for his remiſneſs in the Diſcipline of the Church had been ſuſpended from his Office, and was therefore the Darling of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons becauſe in diſgrace with the <hi>King</hi> (ſo <hi>contrary are the affections of a corrupted State to thoſe of their Governours</hi>) to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it again. Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> the great <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Carliſie.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi>'s Book of <hi>Appello Caeſarem</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in. Proclamations were iſſued out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Papiſts. Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Leader of the Commons, was towards the beginning of this Seſſion, as Sir <hi>John Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> had been at the end of the laſt, called up into the Lord's Houſe, being made Viſcount <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> of the North.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:35342:21"/>
            <p> But the Honours of theſe Perſons (whoſe parts the <hi>King,</hi> who well underſtood men, thought worthy of his Favour and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſeeming the rewards of Sedition, and the ſpoils of deſtructive Counſels, the Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues were more eager in the purſuit of that which theſe had attained unto, by the like Arts. And therefore deſpiſing all the <hi>King</hi>'s obliging practices, in the next Seſſions they aſſumed a power of reforming Church and State, called the Cuſtomers into queſtion for Levying <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> made now their Invectives, as they formerly did againſt the Duke, againſt the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weſton;</hi> ſo that it appeared that not the perſons of men, but the <hi>King</hi>'s truſt of them, was the object of their Envy, and His Favour, though never ſo Vertuous, marked them out for Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. And upon theſe points they raiſed the heat to ſuch a degree, that fearing they ſhould be diſſolved ere they had time to vent their paſſions, they began a Violence upon their own Body (an example which laſted longer than their Cauſe, and at laſt produced the overthrow of all their Priviledges.) They lockt the Doors of the Houſe, kept the Key thereof in one of their own Pockets, held the Speaker by ſtrong hand in the Chair, till they had thundered out their Votes, like dreadful <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> againſt thoſe that ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35342:22"/>Levy, and, which was more ranting, againſt ſuch as ſhould willingly pay the <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi> This Force the <hi>King</hi> went with His Guard of Penſioners to remove; which they hearing, adjourned the Houſe; and the <hi>King</hi> in the Houſe of Lords declaring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of thoſe Vipers who deſtroyed their own Liberties, diſſolved the Parliament.</p>
            <p>While the winds of Sedition raged thus furiouſly at home, more gentle gales came from abroad. The <hi>French</hi> King's deſigns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other places required Peace from us, and therefore the Signiorie of <hi>Venice</hi> by her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors was moved to procure an Accord betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Lewis;</hi> which the King accepted. And not long after [<hi>Anno</hi> 1629] the <hi>Spaniard</hi> preſſed with equal neceſſities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Amity; which was alſo granted. The <hi>King</hi> being thus freed from his domeſtick Embroilments and foreign Enmities, ſoon made the World ſee His Skill in the Arts of Empire, and rendred Himſelf abroad more conſiderable than any of His Predeceſſors. And He was more glorious in the eyes of the good, and more ſatisfied in His own breaſt, by confirming Peace with Prudence, than if He had finiſhed Wars with deſtroying Arms. So that His Scepter was the <hi>Caduceus</hi> to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrate the differences of the Potentates of <hi>Europe.</hi> His Subjects likewiſe taſted the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35342:22"/>of a Reign which Heaven did indulge with all its favours, but only that of valuing their Happineſs. While other Nations wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in blood, His people enjoyed a profound Peace, and that Plenty which the freedom of Commerce brings along with it. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> uſed <hi>London</hi> as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Bank to preſerve and increaſe their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Bullion was here Coined, which advantaged the <hi>King</hi>'s Mint, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Wealth of the Merchants, who returned moſt of that Money in our native Commodities.</p>
            <p>While He diſpenſed theſe Bleſſings to the People, Heaven was liberal to Him in giving Him a Son to inherit his Dominions, <hi>May</hi> 29. [<hi>Anno</hi> 1630.] which was ſo great matter of rejoycing to the People of uncorrupted minds, that Heaven ſeemed alſo concerned in the Exultation, kindling another Fire more than Ordinary, making a <hi>Star</hi> to be ſeen the ſame day at noon. (From which moſt men preſaged that that Prince ſhould be of high Undertakings, and of no common glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Kings: which hath ſince been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the miraculous preſervation of Him, and Heaven ſeemed to conduct Him to the Throne.) For this great bleſſing the <hi>King</hi> gave publick Thanks to the Author of it, Almighty God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church; and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35342:23"/>God was pleaſed in a return to thoſe thanks with a numerous Iſſue afterwards to increaſe this Happineſs. <hi>For neither Armies nor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies are ſuch ſure props of Empire as Children are. Time, Fortune, private Luſts, or Errors may take off, or change Friends: But thoſe that Nature hath united muſt have the ſame Intereſt, eſpecially in Royal Families, in whoſe Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſirangers may have a part, but their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities will be ſure to cruſh their neareſt Allies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proſpering thus in Peace at home, a ſmall time aſſiſted His frugality to get ſuch a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and gave Him leaſure to form ſuch Counſels as might curb the Inſolence of His Enemies abroad. He confederated with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes to give a check to the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Greatneſs, aſſiſting by His Treaſure, Arms and Counſel, the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to deliver the oppreſſed <hi>German</hi> States from the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Oppreſſions. And when <hi>Gustavus</hi>'s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune made him inſolent, and he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unequal Conditions upon the <hi>Paltſgrave,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s Brother-in-Law, He neceſſitated him not withſtanding his Victories to more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Articles.</p>
            <p>The next year was notorious for two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: one of the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> Earl of <hi>Caſtleha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> who being accuſed by all the abuſed parts of his Family of a prodigious wickedneſs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35342:23"/>and unnatural uncleanneſs, was by the <hi>King</hi> ſubmitted to a tryal by his Peers, and by them being found Guilty, was Condemned, and his Nobility could be no patronage for his Crimes; (but in the King's eyes they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more horrid, becauſe they polluted that Order) and was afterwards executed.</p>
            <p>The other was of a tryal of Combat at a Marſhal's Court, betwixt <hi>Donnold</hi> Lord <hi>Rey,</hi> a <hi>Scotiſh High-lander,</hi> and <hi>David Ramſey</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Courtier. <q>The firſt accuſed the laſt to have ſolicited him to a Confederacy with the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who was then Commander of ſome Forces in aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> in which <hi>Ramſey</hi> ſaid all <hi>Scotland</hi> was engaged but three; and that their friends had gotten proviſion of Arms and Powder out of <hi>England;</hi> that the Court was extremely corrupted; and that the matters of Church and State were ſo out of frame as muſt tend to a Change.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There were no Witneſſes, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant denying what the Appellant affirmed, the Tryal was thought muſt be by Duel. In order to which the <hi>King</hi> grants a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a Court-Marſhal: where though the preſumptions of <hi>Ramſey</hi>'s guilt were more heightned, yet the <hi>King</hi> hinders any further proceſs by Combat, which is doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35342:24"/>it be lawful; either thinking none ſo fooliſh as to ſtrive for Empire which He found ſo full of Trouble; or knowing that <hi>Magiſtracy being the ſole Gift of Heaven, it was vain to commit a crime in hope of enjoying it, or in fear of loſing it:</hi> (which was the Principle upon which Excellent Princes have neglected the diligent Inquiſition of Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies) and fatally continues <hi>Hamilton</hi> in that favour as did enable him afterwards more falſly to act that Treaſon of which he was then accuſed.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1632.] Some Tumults in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhewed a defect in that Government, which made the <hi>King</hi> ſend over as Deputy thither the Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> a moſt accompliſhed Perſon in affairs of Rule, of great Abilities equal to a Miniſter of State. The <hi>King</hi>'s choice of him he ſoon juſtified, by reducing that tumultuary people to ſuch a condition of Peace and ſecurity as it had never been ſince its firſt annexion to this Crown, and made it pay for the Charges of its own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which before was deducted out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treaſury: their Peace and Laws now opening acceſſes for Plenty.</p>
            <p>This enjoyment of Peace and Plenty through all the <hi>King</hi>'s Dominions made him mindful of employing ſome fruits of it to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35342:24"/>Honour of that God that cauſed it; and not to let ſo great a Proſperity wholly corrupt the minds of men to a neglect of Religion, (which is uſual) He ſhewed His own Zeal for the Ornaments of it, and ſpent part of His Treaſure towards the repair of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, and by His Example, Admonitions and Commands drew many of His Subjects to a Contribution for it; and had reſtored it to its primitive luſtre and firmneſs, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to a magnificence equal with the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which is ſuppoſed the goodlieſt in the Chriſtian World, had not the Malice of His Enemies forced Him to Arms, mingled His Morter with the blood of innocent people, and ſacrilegiouſly diverted all the Treaſure and Materials gathered for this pious deſign, to maintain an impious and unjuſt War: and afterwards to diſhonour His Cares for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they barbarouſly made it a Stable for their Horſe, and Quarters for their unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Foot.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1633.] Some Reaſons of State drew the <hi>King</hi> from <hi>London, May</hi> 13. to receive the Imperial Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that <hi>He had no great Stomach to the Journey, nor delight in the Nation, being a Race of men, that under the Scheme of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt animoſity and ſpecious plain dealing were moſt perſidious.</hi> A full Character of their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35342:25"/>great Movers. Yet as he had been nobly treated all along His Journey by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, ſo was He there magnificently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and crowned at <hi>Edinburgh, June</hi> 10. But the King ſoon found all thoſe Careſſes falſe. For the Nobility and Laick Patrons could not concoct His <hi>Revocation</hi> (though legal and innocent) of ſuch things as had been ſtolen from the Crown during His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Minority, with a Commiſſion for <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendry</hi> of <hi>Superiorities</hi> and <hi>Tithes</hi> to be reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>King</hi> by the preſent Occupants (who could as then pretend no other Title than the unjuſt uſurpation of their Anceſtors) on ſuch conditions as might bring ſome Profit to the Crown, (to which they juſtly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſome Augmentation to the Clergy, and far more eaſe and benefit to the Common People, whom by advantage of thoſe illegal Tenures they oppreſſed with a moſt bitter Vaſſalage. This Act of His Majeſty being ſo full of equity and publick good, thoſe whoſe greatneſs was builded upon Injuſtice did not bare-facedly oppoſe it, but endeavoured to hinder that and all the other deſigns of Peace and Order, by oppoſing in the Parliament next after the Coronation the Act of <hi>Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of all thoſe Laws which King <hi>James</hi> had made in that Nation for the better regulating the affairs of that Church, both as to the Government and Worſhip of it.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:35342:25"/>
            <p> This was highly oppoſed by ſuch as were ſenſible of their diminution by a legal reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their unrighteous Poſſeſſions. And although the King carried it by the major part of Voices; yet to prevent their own fires with the publick Ruine, they did moſt aſſiduouſly ſlander it among the People as the abetting of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the betraying their Spiritual Liberty to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> yoke. Theſe Calumnies received more credit by the King's Order for a more Decent and Reverend Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God at his Royal Chappl at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> conformably to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Uſage.</p>
            <p>Their noiſe grew louder by the Conſent of their party of <hi>Malecontents</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who alſo took advantage to diffuſe their poiſon from the King's Book of Sports, which King <hi>JAMES</hi> had in his time publiſhed in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and was now ratified by <hi>King CHARLES</hi> for a more univerſal Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. The Occaſion of which was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie of many to <hi>Popery,</hi> (whoſe Doctrines and Practices are more indulgent to the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious) through the rigid opinion of ſome Preachers, who equall'd all Recreations on the Sabbath (as they call'd it) to the moſt prodigious tranſgreſſions. On the contrary, ſome of the Ignorant Teachers had perverted many to downright <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> by the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35342:26"/>of ſo ſtrict an Obſervance of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. And ſome over-buſie Juſtices of Peace had ſuppreſſed all the Ancient Feaſts of the <hi>Dedications</hi> of Churches. The <hi>King</hi> therefore intended by this edict to obſtruct the ſucceſs of the Enemies on both ſides, and to free His People from the yoke of this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. But (<hi>ſuch is the weakneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Prudence, that the Remedies it applies to one Inconvenience are pregnant of another; and whereas the generality of men ſeldom do good but as neceſſitated by Law, when Liberty is indulged, all things are ſoon filled with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and Confuſion.</hi> And ſo) it happened in this, that the Vulgar abuſing the <hi>King</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, (which was no more than is granted in other Proteſtant Churches) and committing many undecencies, made many well-temper'd Spirits too capable and credulous of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Calumnies of the Faction, that His Majeſty was not well-affected to Religion.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1634.] The boldneſs of the <hi>Picke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roons, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk</hi>-Pirates infeſting our Coaſts, damaging our Traffique, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fiſhers on the <hi>King</hi>'s Dominion in the narrow Seas, and His Right diſputed in a Tract by the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> call the <hi>King</hi>'s next Cares for His own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the People's Safety. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy appeared exceeding difficult; the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35342:26"/>of a Navy for ſo honourable an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking being too heavy a burden for His Exchequer; which (although not emptied by any luxuriant Feaſts, nor profuſely waſted on ſome prodigal and unthrifty Favourite, nor laviſhed on ambitious deſigns, from all which deſtructions of Treaſure no King was more free) was but juſt ſufficient for ordinary and neceſſary Expences of State and Majeſty. And though it was moſt juſt for Him to expect the Peoples Contribution to their own Safety, who were never richer than now, nor had they ever more Security for their riches than they now had by His Conceſſions of Liberty: yet knowing how powerful the Faction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was to diſturb the Counſels of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, He feared that from their Proceedings the Common Enemies would be incouraged (as formerly) to higher Inſolencies, and the envious Demagogues would contemn their own ſafety to ruine His Honour. He alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a great unhappineſs to be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to maintain His State by extraordinary ways, and therefore refuſed to renew <hi>Privy Seals</hi> and <hi>Loans,</hi> the uſe of which He debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Himſelf of in granting the Petition of Right. Therefore conſults His Attorney-General <hi>Noy,</hi> whether the <hi>Prerogative</hi> had yet any thing left to ſave an unwilling peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Noy</hi> acquaints Him with <hi>Ancient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of raiſing a Tax upon the Nation for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35342:27"/>forth a Novie in caſe of danger,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures Him of the Legality of the way in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding by Writs to that effect. Which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel being embraced, there were Writs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſeveral Counties for ſuch a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, that in the whole might build, furniſh and maintain 47 Ships for the ſafety of the Kingdom. And by theſe the <hi>King</hi> ſoon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and calmed the Seas; but the Faction endeavoured to raiſe a Tempeſt at Land.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1635.] They complained of Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Liberties, becauſe the Biſhops endeavoured in theſe years to reduce the Ceremonies of the Church to their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Obſervance, of which a long Proſperity had made men negligent: and time had done that to the Spiritual Body which it doth to the Natural, daily amaſſed thoſe Corruptions which at length will ſtand in need of cure. Therefore when they took this proper Method of reforming a corrupted State in bringing things back to their Original Inſtitution, both His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and they were defamed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Tax of Ship-money was pretended a breach to their Civil Liberties, and contrary to Law, becauſe not laid by a Parliament. Therefore thoſe who ſought the People's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to alter the preſent Government, by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35342:27"/>ſeeming the ſingular Patrons of their Rights, refuſed to pay the Tax, [<hi>Anno</hi> 1636.] and ſtood it out to a Tryal at Law. The Juſt <hi>Prince</hi> declined not the Tryal, and permitted Monarchy and Liberty to plead at the ſame Bar. All the Judges of the Land did juſtifie by their Subſeriptions, that <hi>it was legal for the King to levy ſuch a Tax;</hi> and their Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were enrolled in all the Courts of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>-Hall. And when it came to be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Chamber, ten of them abſolutely declared for it; only two, <hi>Crooke</hi> and <hi>Hutton,</hi> openly diſſented from that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to which they had formerly ſubſcribed, not without the ignominy of Levity unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming their places. And as the <hi>King</hi> was thus victorious in the Law, ſo was He at Sea; and having curbed the Pirates, He alſo reduced the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to a precarious uſe of His Seas.</p>
            <p>Amidſt all theſe Difficulties and Calumnies the <hi>King</hi> hitherto had ſo governed, that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men could not pray for, nor Heaven grant in Mercy to a People any greater Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than what his Reign did afford. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire never more flouriſhed with Magnificent Edifices; the Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had brought the wealth of the <hi>Indies</hi> home to our doors; Learning and all good Sciences were ſo cheriſhed, that they grew to Admiration, and many Arts of the Ancients,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35342:28"/>buried and forgotten by time, were revived again. No Subjects under the Sun richer, and (which was the effect of that) none prouder. Security increaſed the Husband-mans ſtock, and Juſtice preſerved his Life; none being condemned as to Life, but by the lawful Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of thoſe of an equal Condition, the Jury of his Peers. The poor might reverence, but needed not Fear the Great: and the Great though he might deſpiſe, yet could not injure his more obſcure Neighbour. And all things were ſo adminiſtred, that they ſeemed to conſpire to the Publick good; except that they made our <hi>Happineſs too much the cauſe of all Civil Commotions,</hi> and brought our Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to that height, that by the neceſſity of humane nature, which hath placed all things in motion, it muſt neceſſarily decline. And God provoked by our ſins did no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and obſtruct the arts and fury of ſome wicked men, who contemning their preſent certain enjoyments, hoped for more wicked acquiſitions in publick Troubles; to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm every part of the <hi>King</hi>'s Dominions with a deluge of Blood and Miſery, and to commence that War, which as it was hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid with much ſlaughter, ſo it was memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the Experiences of His Majeſties Vertues; Confuſions, like Winds, from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Coaſt at once aſſaulting and trying His Righteous Soul.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:35342:28"/>
            <p> The firſt Storm aroſe from the North, and the flame firſt broke out in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where thoſe Lords who feared they ſhould loſe their ſpoils of Religion and Majeſty, took all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to haſten the publick Miſery (which at laſt moſt heavily lay upon their Country, the hands they had ſtrengthened and inſtructed to fight againſt their Prince, laying a more unſupportable ſlavery upon them than their moſt impious Slanders could form in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the credulous that they might fear from the <hi>King</hi>) by calumniating the <hi>King</hi>'s Government, raiſing fears of Tyranny and Idolatry, forming and ſpreading ſeditious Libels. The Author, or at leaſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettor, of one of which was found to be the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> a Traytor by nature, being the Son of one who had before merited death for his Treaſons to King <hi>James,</hi> yet found that mercy from him as the Son now did from King <hi>Charles,</hi> to have his Life and Eſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued after condemnation. Yet this perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man interpreted the <hi>Kings</hi> Clemency for his own Vertue; and he that had dared ſuch a Crime, could not be changed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it; and as if he had rather received an Injury than Life, he was the moſt active in the approaching Rebellion.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1637.] For the Rabble, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in Tumults, were fitted by this and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35342:29"/>other Boutefeus for any occaſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the <hi>King</hi>'s Authority (though His deſigns, that were thus diſpleaſing to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſs, were evidently for the benefit of the Populacy) and at laſt took fire from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, ſomething differing from ours, (leſt a full conſent might argue a dependency upon the Church of <hi>England</hi>) which ſome <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Biſhops had compoſed and preſented to the <hi>King</hi> for the uſe of their Church; which the <hi>King,</hi> who was deſirous that thoſe who were united under His Command might not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in Worſhip, confirmed, and appointed to be firſt read <hi>July</hi> 13. at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a City always pregnant with ſuſpicions and falſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. But it was entertained with all the inſtruments of fury that were preſent to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched multitude: for they flung cudgels and ſticks at the Dean of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> while he was performing his Office; and after that was done re-inforc'd their aſſault upon the Biſhops, whom the Earls of <hi>Roxbrough</hi> and <hi>Traquaire</hi> pretended to protect, who indured ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, that their Patience might provoke a greater rage in the Multitude, which a vigorous puniſhment had eaſily extinguiſhed. For <hi>they that are fierce in a croud, being ſingled, through their particular fears become obedient. And that rabble that talks high againſt the determinations of their Prince, when danger from the Laws is within their ken, diſtruſt their companions, and return to ſubjection.</hi>

            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:35342:29"/>
            <p> But it ſoon appeared that this was not the bare effort of a mutinous Multitude, but a long-formed Conſpiracy; and to this Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whoſe preſent terrour was great, yet would have been contemptible in a ſhort ſpace, there appeared Parties to head them of ſeveral Orders. Who preſently digeſted their Partiſans into ſeveral Tables, and concocted this Mutiny into a formal Rebellion. To proſecute which they mutually obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the whole Nation in a <hi>Covenant</hi> to extirpate <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and whatſoever they pleaſed to brand with the odious names of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and to defend each other againſt all Perſons, not excepting the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reduce this people to more peaceful practices, the <hi>King</hi> ſends Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton</hi> (one who being careſſed by His Majeſties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour had riſen to ſuch a degree of wealth and greatneſs, that now he dreamed of nothing leſs than Empire to bring his power to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, at leaſt to be Monarch of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to which he had ſome pretenſions by his birth) as His Commiſſioner. Who with a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Loyalty diſſembled that pleaſure which he took in the oppoſition of the Covenanters, whoſe firſt motions were ſecretly directed by his counſels, and thoſe of his dependents,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35342:30"/>
               <hi>Traquaire</hi> and <hi>Roxbrough,</hi> for all his Allies were of that party (contrary to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of that Country, where all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Family eſpouſe the part of their Head though in the utmoſt danger:) and his Mother rid armed with Piſtols at her Saddle-bow for defence of the Covenant. By his actings there new ſeeds of Diſcontents and War were daily ſown, and his oppoſitions ſo faint, that he rather encreaſed than allayed their fury: By ſeveral returns to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> for new Inſtructions he gave time to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to conſolidate their Conſpiracy, to call home their Exiles of Poverty that were in foreign Armies, and provide Arms for open Force: By his falſe repreſentations of the ſtate of things, he induced the <hi>King</hi> to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize with the too-potent Corruption of that Nation (an artifice King <hi>JAMES</hi> had ſometimes practiſed) and by granting their deſires, to make them ſenſible of the evils which would flow from their own counſels. Therefore the <hi>King</hi> gave Order for revoking the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> the <hi>High-commiſſion,</hi> the Book of <hi>Canons,</hi> and the Five <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Perth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Covenanters were more inſolent by theſe Conceſſions, becauſe they had gotten that by unlawful courſes and unjuſt force, which Modeſty and Submiſſion had never obtained; and imputing theſe Grants to the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35342:30"/>
               <hi>King</hi>'s Weakneſs, not his Goodneſs, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to bolder Attempts: Indicted an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly without Him, in which they aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> excommunicated the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and all that adhered to them. Afterwards they ſeiſed upon the <hi>King</hi>'s Revenue, ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His Forts and Caſtles, and at laſt put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Arms.</p>
            <p>Provoked with theſe Injuries the <hi>King</hi> amaſſes a gallant Army, in which was a very great appearance of Lords and Gentlemen, and with theſe marches, and incamps within two miles of <hi>Berwick,</hi> within ſight of the Enemy. But their preſent Condition being ſuch as could endure neither War nor Peace, they endeavoured to diſſipate that Army, which they could not overthrow, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to a Pacification. For which they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition'd the <hi>King,</hi> who yielded unto it out of His innate tenderneſs of His Subjects Blood. So an Accord was made <hi>June</hi> 17. [<hi>Anno</hi> 1639.] and the <hi>King</hi> disbands His Army, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould do the like, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Articles of Agreement.</p>
            <p>But they being delivered from Fear, would not be reſtrained by Shame from breaking their Faith. For no ſooner had the <hi>King</hi> disbanded, but they proteſted againſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification,</hi> printed many falſe Copies of it,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35342:31"/>that might repreſent it diſhonourable to the <hi>King,</hi> retained their Officers in pay, changed the old Form of holding Parliaments, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Prerogatives of the Crown, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the <hi>French</hi> King for an aid of men and money.</p>
            <p>This perfidious abuſe of His Majeſty's Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency made thoſe that judge of Counſels by the Iſſue to cenſure the King's Facility. <q>Some wondred how He could imagine there would be any Moderation in ſo corrupt a Generation of men, and that they who had broken the Peace out of a deſire of War, ſhould now lay aſide their Arms out of a love to Quiet. That there would be always the ſame cauſes to the <hi>Scots</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing <hi>England,</hi> and oppoſing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their unquiet nature and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: therefore unleſs ſome ſtrong impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made them either unable or unwilling to diſtract our quiet, the <hi>King</hi> was to look for a ſpeedy return of their Injuries. Others attributed the Accord to the <hi>King</hi>'s ſenſe that ſome eminent Officers in His own Camp were polluted with Counſels not different from the Covenanters: and that <hi>Hamilton</hi> His Admiral had betrayed the ſeaſons of fighting by riding quietly in the <hi>Forth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and had ſecret Conference with His Mother, the great Nurſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35342:31"/>on Shipboard. But moſt referred it to the <hi>King</hi>'s innate tenderneſs of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Blood, and to his Prudence not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file His Glory with the overthrow (which ſeemed probable) of a contemptible Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where the gains of the Victory could not balance the hazards of attempting it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1640.] While men thus diſcourſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> Perfidiouſneſs, the <hi>King</hi> prepares for another Army, and in order thereto calls a Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and another in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for aſſiſtances againſt the Rebels in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> granted Money to raiſe and pay 8000 men in Arms, and furniſh them with Ammunition. Yet this Example with the <hi>King</hi>'s account of the Injuries done to Him and this Nation by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and his promiſe of for ever acquitting them of Ship-money if now they would freely aſſiſt Him, prevailed nothing upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom the Faction drew aſide to other Counſels. And when the King ſent Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vane</hi> to re-mind them of His deſires, and to demand Twelve Subſidies, yet to accept of Six, he induſtriouſly (as was collected from His own and His Sons following pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices) inſiſted upon the Twelve, without inſinuation of the leſſer quantity His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would be contented with; which gave ſuch an opportunity and matter for ſeditious
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35342:32"/>Harangues, that the Houſe was ſo exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that they were about to Remonſtrate againſt the War with <hi>Scotland.</hi> To prevent this ominous effect of the falſeneſs of His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the <hi>King</hi> was forced to diſſolve the Parliament <hi>May</hi> 5. yet continued the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which granted Him 4 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> in the pound for all their Eccleſiaſtical Promotions. But the Laity that in the Houſe had not time to declame againſt His Majeſties Proceedings, did it without doors; for being diſperſed to their homes, they filled all places with ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rumours and high Diſcontents: and in <hi>Southwark</hi> there was an open Mutiny began, which was not pacified without much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Execution of the principal Leaders.</p>
            <p>The King thus betrayed, defamed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by thoſe who ſhould have conſidered that in His Honour their Safety was embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, though He had no leſs cauſe to fear ſecret Conſpiracies at Home, which were more dangerous becauſe obſcure, than the <hi>Scots</hi> publick Hoſtility; yet vigorouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted His undertaking, and raiſed a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Army: but could not do it with equal ſpeed to His Enemies, who had ſoon re-united their diſperſed Forces; and incouraged by the Faction, with whom they held intelligence, in <hi>England,</hi> contented not themſelves to ſtand
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35342:32"/>upon the defence, but invaded us, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſo far before all the <hi>King</hi>'s Army could be gathered together, that they gave a defeat to a Party of it ere the Rear could be brought up by the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who was appointed General, or the <hi>King</hi> could come to encourage them with His Preſence.</p>
            <p>He was no ſooner arrived at His Army, but there followed Him from ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords a Petition, conformable to the <hi>Scotch Remonſtrance,</hi> which they called the <hi>Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Army.</hi> So that His Majeſty might juſtly fear ſome attempts in the South, while He was thus defending Himſelf from the Northern injuries. The <hi>King</hi> anſwered the Petitioners, <hi>That before their Petition came He had reſolved to ſummon all the Peers to conſult what would be moſt for the Safety of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and His own Honour.</hi> Who accordingly met, <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. Where it was determined that a Parliament ſhould be called to meet, <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. and in the mean time a ceſſation ſhould be made with the <hi>Scots,</hi> with whom ſome Commiſſioners from the Parliament ſhould Treat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. Began that fatal Parliament, which was ſo tranſported by the Arts of ſome unquiet perſons, that they diſhonoured the name and hopes of a Parliament, ingulfed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35342:33"/>the Nation in a Sea of Blood, ruined the <hi>King,</hi> and betrayed all their own Priviledges and the People's Liberty into the power of a Phanatick and perfidious Army. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though His Majeſty could not hope to find them moderate, yet He endeavoured to make them ſo; telling them at their meeting, that He was reſolved to put Himſelf freely upon the Affections of His <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects; that He would ſatisfie all their juſt Grievances, and not leave to malice it ſelf a ſhadow to doubt of His deſire to make this a glorious and flouriſhing Kingdom. He commended to their care the chaſing out of the Rebels, the Proviſions of His own Army, and the Relief of the oppreſſed Northern Counties.</p>
            <p>But the Malignity of ſome few, and the Ignorance of more, employed that Aſſembly in other matters: Firſt in purging their Houſe of all ſuch as they conceived would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their deſtructive enterpriſes; and for ſuch men they either ſound ſome fault with their Elections, or made them Criminals in ſome publick Grievance; though others of a deeper guilt they kept among them, that their Offences might make them obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their power, and obſequious to their commands. Then with compoſed Harangues they declaimed upon the publick Grievances, and reckoned up caſual Misfortunes amongſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35342:33"/>deſigned Abuſes of Government, every way raiſing up Contumelies againſt the preſent Power: and that which was fulleſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Envy was applauded as moſt pregnant with Liberty. Thus pretending ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Injuries had been done to the People, they raiſed the Multitude to hopes of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imaginable Liberty, and a diſcontent with the preſent Government. After this they ſet free all the Martyrs of Sedition, that for their malignant Libels had been impriſoned, and three of them were conducted through <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> with ſuch a company of people adorned with Roſemary and Bays, as it ſeemed a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Juſtice and thoſe Tribunals that ſentenced them. Then they fell upon all the chief Miniſters of State: they impeached the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland;</hi> after him the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Finch,</hi> Keeper of the Great Seal, the Judges that according to their Oath had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Ship-money legal, and others; ſome of which fled, thoſe that were found were clapt in Priſon: ſo that the <hi>King</hi> was ſoon deſpoiled of thoſe that were able or faithful to give Him Counſel, and others terrified in their Miniſtery to Him.</p>
            <p>While the Factious thus led the Houſe, their Partiſans without by their Inſtructions formed Petitions againſt the Government in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35342:34"/>Church and State; to which they ſeduced the ignorant Rabble in the City and ſeveral Counties to ſubſcribe, and in a tumultuous manner to preſent them to their Patriots. Who being animated by the ſucceſs of their Arts, fell to draw up a Bill for <hi>Triennial</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, wherein the Power of calling that great Council of the Nation was, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the <hi>King,</hi> and the neglect of others, devolved upon Conſtables. Which profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Majeſty though the <hi>King</hi> diſſwaded them from, yet they perſiſted in; and He paſſed it.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1641.] After five Months time (for ſo long a ſpace they took to rake up Matter and Witneſſes to juſtifie their accuſation, and to give leiſure to the Court for Overtures of gainful Offices to the great Sticklers againſt him; which not appearing) the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> is brought to his Trial in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall before the Lords as his Judges: (the <hi>King, Queen</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> ſitting behind a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in an adjoining Gallery) and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Court ſtood the Commons. His Accuſers and Witneſſes were <hi>Engliſh, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> (and indeed ſo brave a Perſon could not be ruined but by the pretended hatred of the whole Empire) The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſuch as envied his Vertues, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the <hi>King</hi>'s Favour. The <hi>Scotch,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35342:34"/>they knew his Prudence able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-work their Frauds, diſcover their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cheats, and his wiſe management to overthrow their Force. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> hatred aroſe from his juſt and neceſſary Severity in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whereby he had reduced them from ſo great a Barbarouſneſs that was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Peace, to a Civility that was fertile of Plenty; and by Artifices, Husbandry and Commerce had rendred that tumultuary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo rich, that they were now able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treaſury thoſe great Debts which their former Troubles and Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had contracted. Although thoſe of this Nation were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſworn Enemies both of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name and State, and were even then practiſing and meditating their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, (which they hoped more eaſie when ſo wiſe a Governour was removed) and ſo prone enough of themſelves to the Crime; yet were they much careſſed by the Faction, that theſe in the name of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould preſs the <hi>Earl</hi> with envy to the Grave.</p>
            <p>His Charge conſiſted of Twenty eight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles (that their number might cover their want of Evidence.) To all which the <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi> (whoſe Patience was not overcome, nor his nature changed by the Reproaches of his Accuſers) anſwers with ſo brave a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35342:35"/>of Spirit, ſuch firm Reaſons, and ſo clear an Eloquence, that he whom the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Tongues of their Lawyers had rendred as a Monſter of men, could not be found guilty of Treaſon, either in the particulars or the whole. So that his Enemies were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with madneſs that their Charge of Crimes appeared no other than a Libel of Slanders; and the diſ-intereſſed Hearers were (beſides the pleaſure they received to find ſo great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments polluted with no hainous Crimes) ſenſible of the unhappineſs of thoſe who are <hi>Miniſters of State among a Factious people, where their proſperous Counſels are not rewarded, and unſucceſsful, though prudent, are ſeverely accuſed: when they err, every one condemns them, and their wiſe Advices few praiſe; for thoſe that are benefited envy, and ſuch as are diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hate thoſe that gave them.</hi> And ſuch ſeemed the Fate of this Excellent Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, whom nothing elſe but his great Parts, his Maſter's Love and Truſt had expoſed to this Danger.</p>
            <p>The Faction being obſtructed this way, by the Earl's Innocency and Abilities, from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his Life, moved the Houſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by a Bill of <hi>Attainder,</hi> to the making a Law after the Fact, whereby they Vote him guilty of High Treaſon: yet add a Caution, that it ſhould not be drawn into a Precedent,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35342:35"/>ſeeking to ſecure themſelves from a return of that Injuſtice upon themſelves which they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, intending to proſecute what they falſly charged him with, the Alteration of Government. Which yet paſſed not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a long debate and contention: for many that had none but honeſt hopes, diſdained to adminiſter to the Intereſt of the Faction in the blood of ſo much Innocent Gallantry; and thoſe that were prudent ſaw how ſuch an Example opened the avenues to ruine of the beſt Perſons, when once expoſed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hatred. Therefore they earneſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded ſuch a proceed. And fifty nine of the moſt eminent openly diſſented when it came to the Vote; whoſe Names were afterwards poſted, and marked for the fury of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that for the future they might not oppoſe the deſigns of the Factious, unleſs they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be torn in pieces.</p>
            <p>In two days the Lower Houſe paſt the Bill, ſo ſwift were the Demagogues to ſhed blood: but the Lords Houſe was a little more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative (the <hi>King</hi> having amongſt them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared His ſenſe of the Earl's Innocency:) of whoſe ſlow Reſolves the Faction being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, there came a ſeditious rabble of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 5 or 6000 of the dregs of the people, armed with Staves and Cudgels, and other Inſtruments of Outrage, (inſtigated by the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35342:36"/>more unquiet Members both of the Houſe of Commons and City) to the Parliament doors, clamouring <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice:</hi> and the next day, to raiſe their Fury, there was a report ſpred among them of ſome endeavours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare an Eſcape for the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> therefore with more fierceneſs they raiſed their clamors, ſome objecting Treaſon to him, others their Decay of Trade, and each one either as he was inſtructed (for ſome of the Houſe of Commons would be among them, to direct their Fury, and to give ſome order to their Tumult, that it might appear more terrible,) or the ſenſe of his own neceſſities and luſts led him, urged his different motives for Juſtice: and at laſt, heated by their own motion and noiſe, they guard the Doors of the Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> offer inſolencies to the Lords, eſpecially the Biſhops, as they went in, and threaten them if their Votes diſagree from their clamors. And when they had thus made an aſſault on the Liberty of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament (which yet was pretended to be ſo Sacred) they afterward ſet upon the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Abby-Church,</hi> where forcing open the doors they brake down the Organs, ſpoiled all the Veſtments and Ornaments of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: from thence they fly to Court, and diſturb the Peace of it with their undecent and barbarous clamours: and at laſt were raiſed to that impudency, as to upbraid the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35342:36"/>
               <hi>King,</hi> (who from a Scaffold perſwaded them as they paſſed by to a modeſt care of their own private affairs) with an unfitneſs to reign.</p>
            <p>When ſome Juſtices of the Peace, according to the Law, endeavoured to ſuppreſs thoſe Tumults by impriſoning the moſt forward and bold Leaders, they themſelves were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by the Command of the Commons, upon pretext of an injury offered to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subject; of which one was (as they then dictated) <hi>That every one might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly petition the Parliament:</hi> yet when the <hi>Kent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> men came to Petition for ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the guſt of the Faction, they cauſed the <hi>City</hi> Gates to be ſhut upon them; and when other Counties were meditating Addreſſes for Peace, by threatnings they deterred them from ſuch honeſt undertakings. And when ſome prudent Perſons minded the Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues how diſhonourable it was for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament not to ſuppreſs ſuch Mutinies, they replyed, that <hi>their friends ought rather to be thanked and careſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe and other Arts having wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown the freedom of that Council, and many withdrawing themſelves from ſuch Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, when ſcarce the third part of the Peers were preſent, the Faction of that Houſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35342:37"/>paſſed the Bill, the Diſſenters being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted only by ſeven Voices. Yet all this could not prevail upon the <hi>King,</hi> though the Tumults were ſtill high without, and within He was daily ſolicited by the Lords of His Palace (who now looked upon the Earl as the Herd doth on an hurt Deer, and they hoped his Blood would be the Luſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Court) to leave the Earl as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Vulgar Rage. Nor did the <hi>King</hi> any ways yield, till the Judges (who were now obſequious to the pleaſures of the Parliament) declared He might do it by Law, and the Earl by his own Letters devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Victim for the publick Peace and His Majeſties Safety: and then overcome with Importunities on all hands, and being abuſed by bad dealing of the Judges (as Himſelf complained to the Biſhops whom he conſulted in that Caſe, and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who was one of them, anſwered, <hi>That if the</hi> King <hi>in Conſcience found him not guilty, He ought not to paſs the Bill; but for matter of Law, what was Treaſon, he referred Him to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who, according to their Oath, ought to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves indifferently betwixt Him and His Subjects:</hi>) The other four Biſhops that were then conſulted, <hi>Durham, Lincoln, Carliſle,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> were not ſo free as the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King obſerved a ſpecial bleſſing of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35342:37"/>God upon him. He at laſt with much relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy ſigned a Commiſſion to ſome Lords to paſs that Bill of <hi>Attainder,</hi> and another for <hi>Continuation of the Parliament during the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Two Houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The paſſing of theſe two Bills, as ſome thought, wounded the <hi>King</hi>'s Greatneſs more than any thing he ever did. The firſt, becauſe it cut off a moſt exquiſite In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Empire, and a moſt faithful Servant: and none did more make uſe of this to pollute His Honour, than thoſe who had even forced Him to it; like thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and damned Spirits who upbraid unhappy Souls with thoſe Crimes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines to which they themſelves have tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and betrayed them. But the heavieſt Cenſor was Himſelf, for He never left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing His Compliance, or rather Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, with this Murder, till the iſſue of His Blood dried up thoſe of His Tears.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>By the other Bill He had, as ſome cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, renounced His Crown, and granted it to thoſe men who at preſent exerciſed ſo Arbitrary a Power, that they wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but length of time to be reputed Kings, and this they now had gotten. But the more Speculative concluded it an act of eſpecial Prudence, for the <hi>King</hi> made that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35342:38"/>an evidence of His ſincere intention to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige His People, and overcome the Malice of His Enemies with Benefits: which the Faction would have uſurped, and by the boldneſs of the attempt ingaged the People to them as the only Patrons of their Liberty. And they were furniſhed with an Example for it by their Confederates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who indicted an Aſſembly without the <hi>King</hi>'s leave, and continued it againſt His pleaſure; and (as <hi>all imitations of Crimes exceed their firſt pattern</hi>) it was conceived theſe men whoſe furies were more unjuſt, and ſo would be more fierce, intended to improve that Precedent to the extremeſt guilt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill was no ſooner ſigned, but they haſtened the Execution; and ſo much the more eagerly, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> deſired, in a moſt paſſionate Letter delivered by the <hi>Prince</hi> to the Lords, that that Excellent Soul which found ſo much Injuſtice on Earth, might have the more time to fit it ſelf for the Mercy of Heaven. But this favour which became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to grant, agreed not with the Religion of his Adverſaries, and therefore the ſecond day after he was brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> (in his Paſſage thither he had a ſight of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whoſe Prayers and Bleſſing he with a low Obeiſance
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35342:38"/>begged, and the moſt pious Prelate beſtowed them with Tearss,) where with a greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind than he had looked his Enemies in the face did he encounter Death, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his neck to the ſtroke of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner. <q>He was a perſon of a generous Spirit, fitted for the nobleſt enterpriſes, and the moſt difficult parts of Empire. His Counſels were bold, yet juſt, and he had a Vigour proper for the Execution of them. Of an Eloquence, next to that of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's, maſculine, and moſt excellent. He was no leſs affectionate to the Church than to the State, and not contented while li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to defend the Government and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it, he commended it alſo to his Son when he was about to die, and charged his abhorrency of Sacrilege. His Enemies called the Majeſty of his Miene in his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy, Pride, and the undaunted execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Office on the contumacious, the Inſolency of his fortune. He was cenſured for committing that fatal Errour of following the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>London</hi> and to the Parliament after the Pacification with the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>York;</hi> and it was thought, that if he had gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to his charge in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he might have ſecured both himſelf and that Kingdom for His Majeſties Service. But ſome attributed this Counſel to a neceſſity of <hi>Fate, whoſe firſt ſtroke is at the brain of thoſe whom it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35342:39"/>to ruine,</hi> and brought him to feel the effects of Popular Rage, which himſelf in former Parliaments had uſed againſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to find the Experience of his own advices againſt the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham. Providence teaching us to abhor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-fine Counſels by the miſchiefs they bring upon their Authors.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Fall of this Great Man ſo terrified the other Officers of State, that the Lord <hi>High Treaſurer</hi> reſigned his Staff to the Hands from whence he received it; the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> forſook the Maſterſhip of the Court of <hi>Wards;</hi> and the <hi>Guardian</hi> of the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Him to the <hi>King:</hi> Theſe Lords part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Offices, like thoſe that ſcatter their Treaſure and Jewels in the way, that they might delude the violence of their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy purſuers. But the <hi>King</hi> was left naked of their faithful Miniſtery, and expoſed to the Infuſions and Informations of thoſe who were either Complices or Mercenaries to the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to whom they diſcovered his moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Counſels.</p>
            <p>When the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was dead, then did the Parliament begin to think of ſending away the <hi>Scots,</hi> who hitherto had much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed the Northern Counties, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the charges of the Nation: but now
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35342:39"/>they were Voted to receive 300000 pound, under the notion of a Brotherly Aſſiſtance, but in truth, deſigned by the Faction, as a reward for their Clamours for the <hi>Earls</hi> Blood; yet were they kept ſo long till the <hi>King</hi> had paſſed away more of His Prerogative, in ſigning the Bills to take away the <hi>High-Commiſſion</hi> and the <hi>Star Chamber.</hi> After which ſpoils of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty they disband the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Armies, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. and on the 10. of that Month the <hi>King</hi> follows them into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſettle, if it were poſſible, that Kingdom. But the <hi>King</hi> ſtill found them as before: when He ſatisfied their greedy appetites, then would they offer Him their Lives and Fortunes; but when gain or advantage appeared from His Enemies, they appeared in their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ungrateful, changeable and perfidious, whom no favours could oblige, nor any thing but Ruine was to be expected by building up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Love.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>King</hi> was in <hi>Scotland</hi> labouring to ſettle that Nation by granting all that the Covetouſneſs and Ambition of their Leaders pretended was for the Publick good, and ſo aimed at no leſs than a Miracle, by His Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to reduce <hi>Faith</hi> (which, <hi>like Life, when it is once departed doth never naturally return</hi>) into thoſe perfidious breaſts; the Parliament adjourns, and leaves a ſtanding <hi>Committee</hi> of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35342:40"/>ſuch as were the Leaders or the Servants of the Faction. Theſe prepared new Toils for His Majeſties Return, and by them was the <hi>Grand Remonſtrance</hi> formed: in it were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned for Grievances all the Complaints of men that were impatient of Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Offences of Courtiers, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Reſolves of Judges, the Neglects or Rigours of the Miniſters of Juſtice, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted Sermons of ſome Preachers, yea, the Poſitions of ſome Divines in the Schools, were all exaggerated to defame the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment both in Church and State, and to magnifie the skill of theſe State-Phyſicians that offered Preſcripts for all theſe Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Beſides, more eaſily to abuſe the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who reckon Misfortunes as Crimes,</hi> unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing accidents were repreſented as deſigns of Tyranny; and thoſe things which had been reformed, were yet mentioned as continued burthens. From which the people were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured there could be no deliverance but by the wiſdom and magnanimity of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants.</p>
            <p>To prepare the way for this, the moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious parts of it were firſt whiſpered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Populacy, that by this ſeeming ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion men impatient of Secrets might more eagerly divulge them, and the danger appear greater by an affected ſilence. Then prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35342:40"/>Calumnies (which none but ſouls prone to any wickedneſs could believe of ſo Great a man) were formed of the <hi>King,</hi> and ſuch ſuſpicions raiſed of Him and His Friends, as might force them to ſome Injuries which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they forbore, and by ſecuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves increaſe the Publick fears. For <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do rather provoke moſt men than amend them; and the provoked think more of their ſafety, than to adjuſt their actions againſt their malicious Slanderers.</hi> And when the minds of men were made thus ſolicitous concerning Dangers from the <hi>King,</hi> to make them more pliable and ductile, there was repreſented to them an inevitable anger of Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſent ſtate of things both in Church and State, teſtified by many Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies that were related, and portentuous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Ruine. Certain Prophecies (for a credulity to which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vulgar are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous) from unknown Oracles are divulged, which enigmatically deſcribe the <hi>King</hi> as a Monſter, and from ſuch a Prince muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a change of Government. Some vain perſons alſo, that gave themſelves up to the Impoſture of Aſtrology, were hired to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the people with the unſignificant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of Stars, and from them to foretel ruines to the better part of the World, and an imminent deſtruction on men of the Long Robe, and Alterations of States.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:35342:41"/>
            <p> Theſe were done to temper the minds of men by ſuperſtition for a guidance of their Miniſters, who being conceived to be the Ambaſſadours of Heaven, were ſuppoſed to have it in their Commiſſion, to declare the Conditions of War and Peace: and theſe, either through the ſame weakneſs capable of the like terrors with the Vulgar, or (which is more to be abhorred) corrupted, as ſome were, by the Careſſes and gainful hopes that the Faction baited them with, did juſtifie their fears and increaſe them by applying ſome obſcure Prophecies in Scripture to the preſent Times and People; compared the pretended Corruptions of our Church with the Idolatries of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and whatſoever was condemned in the Holy Records, was paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd with the things they diſliked here, and all the Curſes that God poured upon His irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable and obdurate enemies, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſuch as differ'd from them, or would not joyn with the Faction.</p>
            <p>To make theſe Harangues more efficacious, the Authors of them received the Reverence of the Demagogues, who (deſpiſing, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning and expoſing to Affronts ſuch ſober Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines as would have cured the madneſs of the People,) appropriated to ſuch Teachers the Titles of Saints, Faithful Miniſters, Precious men; and they on the other ſide made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35342:41"/>of Epithets to their Maſters, of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Moſt High, ſuch as were to do the Work of the Lord; That by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels men were to expect new Heavens and a new Earth; that they were men that ſhould prepare the Kingdom for Jeſus Chriſt, and lay the Foundations of the Empire of the Saints which was to laſt a Thouſand years. To make the Cry yet louder, they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Sects and Hereſies a Licence of publick profeſſion, (which hitherto Diſcipline, the Care of the Common Peace and Religion had confined to ſecret corners) and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Office of Teaching to every bold and ignorant undertaker; ſo that at laſt the dregs of the People uſurped that Dignity, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had parted with the natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of their Sex, would not only ſpeak, but alſo rule in the Church. All theſe, in gratitude for their Licentiouſneſs, ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to their hearers the admiration of the Authors of it, and bitterly inveighted againſt thoſe whom the Care both of the Souls and Fortunes of men would excite to repreſs them, in many of their Raptures denouncing Wo and Judgment to the lawful Governours in Church and State.</p>
            <p>While all theſe Methods of Ruine were preparing her, the ſame anger of God, the ſame madneſs of men raiſed up another Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35342:42"/>in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords and Prieſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who were the prime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Tragedies there,) were incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Succeſs of the <hi>Scots, who by a proſperous Rebellion</hi> (as the Hiſtorian of thoſe Troubles writes) <hi>had procured for themſelves ſuch large Privileges,</hi> to an imitation, which the preſent Jealonſies in <hi>England</hi> (where mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contraſts would employ all their force upon one another,) promiſed to be ſecure. And they had an happy opportunity by the Vacancy in Government through the ſlaughter of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> with whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords (while they proſecuted him in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) had removed all thoſe other inferiour Magiſtrates that were moſt skilful in the affairs of that Kingdom, by accuſing to the Faction ſome of them of Treaſon, and others of an inclination to the <hi>Earl,</hi> and had got prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their charges ſuch as were either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacquainted with the <hi>Genius</hi> of that People, or favourers of the Conſpiracy. A ſtrength they had alſo ready; for thoſe 8000 which had been liſted for the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were unſeaſonably disbanded, and the <hi>King</hi> in foreſight they might cauſe ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in their own Country, and therefore promiſed 4000 of them to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> yet would not the Parliament conſent to their departure, becauſe (as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted) it would diſpleaſe the King of <hi>France;</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:35342:42"/>and when the <hi>King</hi> promiſed to ſend as many to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, that likewiſe was not reliſhed. The Common Souldiers of that Army being thus made uſeleſs, and therefore like men of their employment moſt fierce when they were to be diſmiſſed from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of War, were eaſily drawn into the Rebellion, although very few of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were polluted with the Crime.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords and Prieſts being allured by theſe our Vices and theſe ſeveral opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, began their Rebellion <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> throughout that whole Kingdom on a ſudden invading the unprovided <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were ſcattered among them, deſpoiling them of their Eſtates, Goods, and many thouſands of their Lives, without any reſpect of Sex, Age, Kindred or Friendſhip, and made them as ſo many Sacrifices to their bloody Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. They miſſed but a little to have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed <hi>Dublin.</hi> But their Conſpiracy being detected there and in ſome few other places, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name and intereſt was preſerved in that Kingdom, till they could receive Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from hence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> had the firſt intelligence of it, in its very beginnings, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſent Sir <hi>James Stuart</hi> to the Lords of the Privy Council in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to acquaint
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35342:43"/>them with His Knowledge, and Inſtructions, and to carry all that Money that His preſent Stores could ſupply. Beſides, He moves the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as being neareſt, to a ſpeedy help; who decline their Aids, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> was dependent upon the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> At the ſame time alſo He ſends poſt to the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> who leſs regard it, the Faction applauding their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, that new Troubles were ariſen to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the <hi>King,</hi> and that the Royal Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus aſſaulted in all three Nations, there muſt ſhortly ariſe ſo many new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. Beſides that it yielded freſh matter of reproach to His Majeſty, to whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels at firſt ſecretly they whiſpered, and at laſt publickly imputed that horried Maſſacre. Which Slanders were coloured by the Arts of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, who, to diſhearten the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from any reſiſtance, bragged <hi>that the Queen was with their Army; That the King would come amongſt them with Auxiliary Forces; That they did but maintain His Cauſe against the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; That they had the Kings Comiſſion for what they did,</hi> ſhewing indeed a Patent that themſelves had drawn, but thereto was affixed an Old broad Seal that had been taken from an obſolete Patent out of <hi>Farnham</hi> Abby, by one <hi>Plunckett,</hi> in the preſence of many of their Lords and Prieſts, as was afterwards atteſted by the Confeſſion of many. <hi>Thatthe Scots were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35342:43"/>in confederacy with them,</hi> to beget a faith of which, they abſtained from the lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes of thoſe of that Nation among them.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, to encourage the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their own party, they produce ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Letters, wherein they were informed from <hi>England</hi> that <hi>the Parliament had paſſed an Act, that all the Iriſh ſhould be compelled to the Proteſtant Worſhip; that for the firſt offence they ſhould forfeit all their Goods, for the ſecond their Eſtates, and for the third their Lives.</hi> Beſides, they preſent them with the hopes of Liberty: <hi>That the Engliſh Yorke ſhould be ſhaken off; that they would have a King of their own Nation; and that the Goods and Eſtates of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhould be divided among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi> And with theſe hopes of Spoil and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were driven to ſuch a Fury, that they committed ſo many horrid and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous acts as ſcarce ever any Age or People were guilty of.</p>
            <p>In the mean while nothing was done for the relief of the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, but only ſome Votes paſſed againſt the Rebels, till the <hi>King</hi> returned to <hi>London,</hi> which was about the end of <hi>November:</hi> where He with the Queen and the Prince were magnificently feaſted by the Citizens, and the Chief of them afterwards by Him at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court. For
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35342:44"/>he never neglected any honeſt Arts to gain His Peoples love; to which they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prone enough, had not His Enemies methods and impulſes depraved their <hi>Genius.</hi> But this much troubled the Faction, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied that Reverence to Majeſty in others which was not in themſelves, and they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make theſe loves ſhort and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; for they diſcountenanced the prime ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers of this Honour to the <hi>King,</hi> and were more eager to render Him odious. For having gotten a Guard about them, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſinuated into the people dangerous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions as the cauſe of that Guard, and every day grew more nice, and jealous of their Priviledges, and Power. The <hi>King's</hi> advices to more tenderneſs of His Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or His Advertiſements of the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſpeeches that were uttered in their Houſe, they interpret as encroachments upon their Grandeur, and upbraided the <hi>King</hi> for them in their Petitions to Him.</p>
            <p>But their greateſt effort upon Majeſty was the Remonſtrance; after which they took all occaſions to magnifie the apprehenſions of thoſe Fears which they had falſly pretended to in it. This the Faction had before form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and now brought into the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; where it found a ſtrong oppoſition by thoſe wiſe men that were tender of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35342:44"/>Peace and Common Good: though thoſe who preferred their Private to the General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and every one that was ſhort-ſighted and iprovident for the future, were ſo fierce for it, that the Debates were continued all night till ten a clock the next morning, ſo that many of the more aged, and perſons of beſt fortunes (not accuſtomed to ſuch watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) were wearied out, and many others, not daring to provoke the Faction in this their grand Deſign, left the Houſe; ſo that at laſt they carried it, yet but by eleven Votes. Which they preſented with a Petition to take away the Votes of Biſhops in the Houſe of Lords, and the Ceremonies in the Church, and to remove thoſe Perſons from His Truſt which they could not confide in; yet named none, but only accuſed all under the name of a <hi>Malignant Popiſh</hi> Party. Which they had no ſooner delivered than they cauſed it to be publiſhed in Print.</p>
            <p>To which the <hi>King</hi> anſwers in another publick Declaration, but ſo muc to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of the Demagogues, to find their Methods of Ruine ſo fully diſcovered as they were in His Majeſties Anſwer, that they had recourſe to their former ſovereign Rememdy, which ſober men accounted a crime, and an indignity to Government, the Tumults of the Rabble. Who in great numbers and much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35342:45"/>confuſion came up to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſome cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt Biſhops, others belching their fury againſt the Liturgy, and a third party roaring that the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be taken out of the <hi>King</hi>'s hands. To their Clamours they added rude Affronts to thoſe Lords whom their Leaders had taught them to hate, and eſpecially to the Biſhops, at their going in or coming out of the Houſe: and afterwards drawing up to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> they appeared ſo inſolent, as it was evident they wanted only ſome to begin, for there were enough to proſecute an Aſſault upon the <hi>King</hi> in His own Palace.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops thus rudely excluded from their Right and Liberty of coming to the Parliament, Twelve of them afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt the Proceedings of it, during their ſo violent Excluſion. Which Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Commons preſently accuſed of High Treaſon, and cauſed their Commitment to the <hi>Tower;</hi> where they continued them till the Bill againſt their Votes in the Lords Houſe was paſt, that they might not produce their Reaſons for their Rights, and againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice offered unto them, and then afterwards releaſed them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> alſo ſaw it neceſſary to take a Guard of ſuch Gentlemen as offered their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35342:45"/>for His Safety, and to prevent the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of Majeſty by the rude fury of the People, who uſed to make their Addreſſes acceptable at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by offering int heir paſſage ſome baſe Affronts at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> But when the terrour of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>

               </gap>ard had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to ſome leſs degree of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, they then, inſtructed by their Heads, laboured to make it more unſafe to the <hi>King,</hi> by ſeeking to raiſe the Rage and Jealouſie of the whole City againſt Him. For at midnight there were cries out in the Street, that all People ſhould ariſe to their defence; for the <hi>King</hi> with His <hi>Papiſts</hi> were coming to fire the City, and cut their throats in their beds. Than which though nothing was more falſe, yet it found the effects of truth; and the People by ſuch Alarms being terrified from ſleep, the impreſſions of thoſe nightly fears lay long upon their Spirits in the day, and filled them almoſt with Madneſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> therefore, not alwaies to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage theſe Violences with Patience, but at laſt by a courſe of Juſtice to take off thoſe whom He had found to be the Authors of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Counſels, the grand Movers of theſe Seditious practices, and, which was more, the Inviters of a Foreign Force, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, into this Nation; commands His Atturney General to accuſe Five Members of the Hourſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35342:46"/>of Commons, and one of the Lords, upon Articles of High Treaſon, to be tried accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of the Land: and He alſo ſends ſome other Officers to ſeal up their Trunks and Cabinets in their ſeveral Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to ſecure their Perſons. This being related to the Houſe of Commons (wherein the Faction was now grown more powerful, and with whom did joyn many men of Integrity in this Occurrence, being too careful of the Priviledges of their Houſe, which yet ſecure none of the Members againſt Juſtice for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Felony or Treaſon) they were ſo far from admitting the <hi>King</hi>'s Charge againſt them, that they accuſed the <hi>King</hi> of breach of Priviledge, and Vote all thoſe guilty of Enmity to the Common-wealth that ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the <hi>King</hi> in any of His Commands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.</p>
            <p>This Obſtruction of Juſtice ſo far moved the <hi>King,</hi> together with the Advice of ſome of His Council that were alſo of the Houſe of Commons, as alſo an hope of rooting up the Faction this way, that none through the hope of Concealment ſhould be incouraged to conſpire the publick Ruine, that He Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with about an hundred Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and their followers, went to the Houſe of Commons: Where commanding His At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to move no further than the Stairs,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35342:46"/>to offer no violence, nor return any uncivil language to any although provoked, Himſelf with the <hi>Paltzgrave</hi> only enters the Houſe, and demands that the Incendiaries might be delivered into His hands, with whom He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to deal no otherwiſe than according to the Law. But they whom he ſought, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore informed (as it is reported) of the <hi>King</hi>'s coming by the ſecret Intelligence of Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and a Court Lady (who having loſt the Confluence of Servants with her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſought now to prevent a ſolitude by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick miniſteries) had forſook the place, and withdrawn themſelves into the sanctuary of the <hi>City.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>King</hi> having renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His Charge, without injury to any, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately departs.</p>
            <p>But the Faction would not let Him ſo reſt, but proſecuted this attempt of His with all the Clamours that they poſſibly could raiſe, ſpread the ſparks of Diſſention far and wide, make the common people mad with Fears and Diſtractions, ſtir up ſome in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to bring Petitions for the impeached Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and their violated Priviledges; and at laſt prepare an armed Rabble diſpoſed into Order to bring the accuſed Demagogues to the Houſe from their Coverts in <hi>London.</hi> This coming to the knowledge of the <hi>King,</hi> although many Gallant and faithful Perſons
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35342:47"/>proffered their Service by mingling with the Rout, or by being as Spectators, to curb any Inſolencies that ſhould be attempted on Him; yet was He reſolved to withdraw Himſelf with the Queen and their Children to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> that He might permit their Fury to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh when it had no oppoſition, and to give time for their jealouſies and rumours to wax old and periſh. For <hi>the firſt Indignation of a mutinous Multitude is moſt fierce, and a ſmall delay breaks their conſent:</hi> and <hi>Majeſty would have a greater Reverence, if any, at a diſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s Wiſdom was perceived by His Enemies, and therefore to counterwork it, and not to let the people ſleep without fear, leſt they ſhould come to be ſober, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the love of Obedience, ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports were every day brought of dangers from the <hi>King:</hi> That troops of Papiſts were gathered about <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> where the County Magazine was lodged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the Lord <hi>George Digby,</hi> who was then famed to be a <hi>Papist,</hi> (though at that time he was an elegant Aſſertor of the Proteſtant Faith,) and Col. <hi>Lunsford,</hi> who was characteriſed to be of ſo monſtrous an appetite that <hi>he would eat Children.</hi> And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſent to take them both, which found no ſach dreadful Preparations. At other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35342:47"/>times, when the People on the Lord's dayes were at Divine Worſhip, they were diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it by Alarms, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (who and from whence none could tell) were up in Arms, and were juſt then about to fire their Houſes, and mix their Blood with their Prayers: That there were Forces kept in Grotts and Caves under ground, that ſhould in the night break out into the midſt of the City, and cut all their throats: And what was more prodigious, and though ridiculous, yet had not a few believers in <hi>London,</hi> That there were deſigns by Gunpowder to blow up the <hi>Thames,</hi> and choak them with the water in their beds. Thus were the people taught to hate their Prince, and by bloody news from every Quarter they were inſtructed to that Cruelty which they vainly feared, and to adore thoſe by whoſe Counſels they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſo unexpected Dangers.</p>
            <p>By all this the Faction gained the repute of Modeſty inferiour to their ſuppoſed Truſt, when they demanded nothing elſe but the Command of the Tower, and the <hi>Militia</hi> of all the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> together with the Forts and Caſtles of the ſame. For all which they moved the Houſe of Commons to petition: who deſiring the Conjuncture of the Lords in the ſame, were wholly refuſed by them. Therefore ſtemmed by the Faction
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35342:48"/>they petition alone. Which unlimited Power the <hi>King</hi> abſolutely refuſed to grant unto them, who He foreſaw would uſe that, as they had all His other Conceſſions, to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the Author of their Power. Yet was pleaſed to conſent, after He had demonſtrated the prejudice they required to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that they might ſend over an Army of 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and deliver un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the ſtrong Town and Port of <hi>Carick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus,</hi> one of the Chief Keys of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: which was done to oblige the <hi>Scots</hi> to them in their future deſigns. And alſo He was pleaſed to wave the Proſecution of the Impeached Members, and was willing to grant a Free and General Pardon for all His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as the Parliament ſhould think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
            <p>But all this could not content them who had immoderate deſires, and they were more diſcontented that they could not uſurp the <hi>King</hi>'s Rights, than if they had loſt their own Priviledges: therefore to bring the Lords to a concurrence with them, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto proſperous Art of Tumultuous Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was again practiſed, and great Numbers from ſeveral Counties were moved to come as Earthquakes, to ſhake the Fundamental Conſtitutions of their Houſe, and to require that neither the Biſhops nor the Popiſh Lords
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35342:48"/>ſhould continue in their Ancient Right to Vote among the Peers. By this means they ſhould weaken the <hi>King</hi> in the Voices of that Houſe, and whoſoever they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in, they could fright him from Voting againſt them, by expoſing him as Popiſh to the Popular Fury. For this was the method of uſing the Petitions. The moſt common Anſwer was with Thanks, and that <hi>the Houſe of</hi> Commons <hi>were juſt now in conſideration thereof.</hi> The Petitioners were taught to reply, that <hi>They doubted not of the care of the</hi> Commons <hi>Houſe, but all their diſtruſt was in the Hearts of the</hi> Lords, <hi>where the Popiſh Lords and Biſhops had the greateſt Power, and there it ſtuck, whoſe names they deſired to know:</hi> and in this they were ſo earneſt, that they would not willingly withdraw whileſt it was debated, and then they had leave to depart with this Anſwer, <hi>That the Houſe of</hi> Commons <hi>had already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured Relief from the Lords in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and ſhall ſo continue till Redreſs be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi> Such Petitions as theſe were likewiſe from the ſeveral Claſſes of the inferiour Tradeſmen about <hi>London, as Porters, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and the like: and that nothing of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying an univerſal Importunity might be left unattempted, <hi>Women</hi> were perſwaded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Petitions to the ſame effect. While the Faction thus boaſted in the ſucceſs of their Arts, Good men grieved to ſee theſe daily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famies
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35342:49"/>of the ſupreme Council of the Nation, all whoſe Secrets were publiſhed to the loweſt and weakeſt part of the People: and they who clamoured it as a breach of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the <hi>King</hi> took notice of their Debates, now made them the Subjects of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in every Shop, and all the corners of the Street; where the good and bad were equally cenſured, and the Honour and Life of every Senator expoſed to the Verdict of the Rabble. No Magiſtrate did dare to do his Office, and all things tended to a manifeſt Confuſion: So that many ſober Perſons did leave <hi>the Kingdom,</hi> as <hi>unſafe, where Factions were more powerful than the Laws. And Juſt Perſons choſe rather to hear than to ſee the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Reproaches of their Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, to make the <hi>King</hi> more plyable, they tempt Him by danger in His moſt beloved Part, the <hi>Queen,</hi> concerning whom they cauſed a Rumour, that <hi>they did intend to impeach Her of High Treaſon.</hi> This Rumour made the deeper Impreſſion, becauſe they had raiſed moſt prodigious Slanden (which are the firſt Marks for deſtruction of Princes) on Her; and when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all other Counſellors from the <hi>King.</hi> She was famed to be the Rock upon which all hopes of Peace and Safety were ſplit: That She comanded no leſs His Counſel
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35342:49"/>than Affections, and that His Weakneſs was ſo great, as not to conſent to or enterprize any thing which She did not firſt approve: That She had perverted Him to Her Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and formed deſigns of overthrowing the Proteſtant Profeſſion. Theſe and many other of a portentuous falſhood were ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Vulgar, who are alwayes most prone to believe the Worst of Great Perſons: and the uncontrolled Licence of reporting ſuch Calumnies is conceived the first Dawning of Liberty.</hi> But the Parliament taking notice of the Report, ſent ſomne of their Houſe to purge themſelves from it, as <hi>an unjust Scandal caſt upon them.</hi> To which the <hi>Queen</hi> midly anſwers, <hi>That there was a general Report thereof, but She ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw any Articles in writing, and having no certain Author for either, She gave little credit thereto; nor will She believe they would lay any Aſperſion upon Her, who hath been very unapt to miſconſtrue the Actions of any One perſon, and much more the Proceedings of Parliament, and ſhall at all times wiſh an Happy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding between the King and His People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>King</hi> knowing how uſual it was for the Faction by Tumults and other Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to tranſport the Parliament from their juſt Intentions in other things, and that they might do ſo in this, reſolved to ſend Her into <hi>Holland,</hi> under colour of accompanying their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35342:50"/>Eldeſt <hi>Daughter,</hi> newly married to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but in truth to ſecure Her, ſo that by the fears of Her danger (who was ſo dear unto Him) He might not be forced to any thing contray to His Honour and Conſcience, and that Her Affections and Relation to Him might not betray Her Life to the Malice of His Enemies. With Her He alſo ſent all the Jewels of the Crown, that they might not be the ſpoils of the Faction, but the means of the ſupport of Her Dignity in foreign parts, if His Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities afterwards ſhould not permit Him to provide for Her otherwiſe. Which yet She did not ſo employ, but reſerved them for a ſupply of Ammunition and Arms, when His Adverſaries had forced Him to a neceſſary Defence. It was ſaid that the Faction knew of this conveyance, and might have prevented it, but that they thought it for their greater advantage that this Treaſure ſhould be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, that the <hi>King</hi> in confidence of that aſſiſtance might take up Arms, to which they were reſolved at laſt to drive Him. For they thought their Cauſe would be better in War than Peace, becauſe their preſent Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in the ſenſe of the Law actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions; and a longer time would diſcover thoſe Impoſtures by which they had deluded the People, who would ſoon leave them (as many now did begin to repent of their Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) to the Vengeance which was due to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35342:50"/>their practices, unleſs they were more firmly united by a communion of guilt in an open aſſaulting their Lawful Prince.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> haſtens the ſecurity of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and accompanies Her as far as <hi>Dover,</hi> there to take his farewel of Her; a buſineſs almoſt as irkſome as death, to be ſeparated from a Wife of ſo great Affections and eminent Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and that which made it the more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, that the ſame cauſe which forced Her Separation from Him ſet Her at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from His Religion, (the only thing wherein their Souls were not united) even the Barbarity of His Enemies who profeſſed it, yet were ſo irreconcileable to Vertue, that they hated Her for Her Example of Love and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to Him. While He was committing Her to the mercy of the Winds and waves, that She might eſcape the Cruelty of more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and faithleſs men, they proſecute Him with their diſtaſteful Addreſſes, and at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> preſent Him with a Bill for taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Biſhops Votes in Parliament. Which having been caſt out of the Houſe of Peers ſeveral times before, ought not by the Courſe and Order of Parliament to have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted again the ſame Seſſion. But the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had now uſed their accuſtomed Engine, a Tumult, and it was then paſſed by the Lords, and brought hither together with ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35342:51"/>Threats, that if it were not ſigned, the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould not be ſuffered to depart. (By ſuch impious Violences did they make way for that which they call'd <hi>Reformation.</hi>) This His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſigns, (though after it made a part of His penitential Confeſſions to God) in hopes that that Bill being once conſented to, the Fury of the Faction, which with ſo great Violence purſued an abſolute Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eccleſiaſtical Government, would be abated, as having advanced ſo far in their deſign to weaken the <hi>King</hi>'s Power in that Houſe by the loſs of ſo many Voices, which would have been always on that ſide where Equity and Conſcience did moſt appear. But He ſoon found the Demagogues had not ſo much Ingenuity as to be compounded with and they made this but a ſtep to the over throw of that which He deſigned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>When His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was come back as far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> He met with many information how averſe the Faction was to Peace, and that their Proceedings were raiſed to a level with their Principles, which ſome of them publiſhed, <hi>That the Alteration they did intend, and which was neceſſary both in Church and State, must be made by Blood.</hi> Therefore they endeavoured by their Calumnies to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate an Hatred of Him, and to deſpoil Him
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35342:51"/>of all the hopeful Effects of His Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. For <hi>when a Prince is once hated, his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits do him no leſs hurt than Injuries.</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> had publickly charged Him with a Connivence at leaſt if not with the Contrivance of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many Papiſts had His <hi>Majeſties</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Warrant for their tranſport thither. This the <hi>King</hi> requires ſatisfaction for, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Falſhood and Malice of the Defamer, by giving an Account of the date of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Warrants. But the Faction ſo far prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to make it a Publick Sin, and the Houſe was perſwaded to believe and acknowledge it to be their common ſenſe. Many others had uttered ſeditious Speeches in the Houſe, eſpecially Maſter <hi>Marten,</hi> a man of all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, a publick contemner of Religion and Honeſty, that had waſted a large Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (which he had likewiſe unjuſtly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſeveral and different Creditors) in the moſt infamous Luſts, and ſought a greater licence and freſh ſupplies for them by the ruine of the State; at which he was power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, being of as impure and laſcivious a Wit as he was of Life, wherewith he uſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane God and His Vicegerents: yet ſerving the ends of Confuſion, had his name among the Catalogue of thoſe that were to do the <hi>Work of the Lord.</hi> Beſides the attempts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Honour, they endeavour another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35342:52"/>His Family, and to ſeize upon the <hi>Prince.</hi> Which the <hi>King</hi> hearing, ſends for Him and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and immediately removes to <hi>Theobalds</hi> in order to His journey towards the North, where He intended to ſettle His abode, till He ſaw what Iſſue this Storm would have.</p>
            <p>This removal of the <hi>King</hi> was variouſly cenſured. <q>Some thought it unadviſedly done, to withdraw ſo far from <hi>London,</hi> to leave His chief City wholly to the practices, and expoſe His Friends there to the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and Injuries of His Enemies. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially the Friends of the Faction, defamed it as a preparing Himſelf for that War which followed. But others concluded it as an act of Neceſſity, and where there was no choice for Prudence. For when He had paſſed more obliging Acts, and parted with ſo much of His Prerogative and ſo many undoubted Rights of His Crown, as could not be equalled by the Grants of all His Predeceſſors, yet He found that He had effected nothing more by giving, than to make the Faction more eagerly deſire what they knew He muſt in Honour and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence deny; and that the People were ſo bewitched as not to ſee, <hi>it is ſafer to truſt Him who was contented with a leſs degree of Power, than thoſe whoſe ambition and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35342:52"/>knew no bounds:</hi> Who being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded as ſo far to adminiſter to the Luſts of their Diſturbers, would not fail their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſeize upon His Perſon, unleſs in time He did provide for His Liberty. Nor could it be imagined that He meditated a War, who to make His People happy (if they had not deſpiſed their own Mercies) had deprived Himſelf of a power to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it. For beſides thoſe Acts formerly mentioned, He had ſigned many other as prejudical to ſuch an undertaking. For He had paſſed Acts againſt His own Power of Impreſſing Souldiers, His Right to Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Poundage, the Stannary Courts, Clerk of the Market, the Preſidial Courts in the North, and Marches of <hi>Wales;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by He had not only diminiſhed His Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that Reverence which was due to the Crown, but alſo ſo ſtraitened His Revenue as it was not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Diſcipline, without which no hopes of Victory, eſpecially in a Civil War.</hi> Beſides, His Enemies in every County had injured His <hi>Fame,</hi> which <hi>is of great moment in the deciding Controverſies by the Sword;</hi> and the City of <hi>London,</hi> which is the grand Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie of the Wealth and Strength of the whole Nation, was now enſlaved by the Rabble to their commands. All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations as they could not eſcape ſo Wiſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35342:53"/>a Prince, ſo would they not permit the Deſigns of War, eſpecially in that Breaſt, to which it was equally miſerable to ſuffer the ſpilling of His Subjects blood, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Himſelf to Ruine. So that His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>London</hi> was not of Deſign, but Neceſſity, nor was there in it more of Fear than Shame; for He could no longer endure thoſe deteſtable <hi>Spectacula</hi> in which Tumults like Beaſts were let looſe to aſſault the Majeſty of Government.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While the <hi>King</hi> thus provides for His Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the Faction proceed to uſurp the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> which His Majeſty had denied, and the Lords were aſhamed to ask: therefore they privately incourage their Partiſans in all the Cities and Boroughs where they were moſt powerful, to appoint Muſters, to arm and train their Youth, and module them into Companies; which afterwards (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law) they move the Lower Houſe to Vote Legal, and to make an Order in the Name of the Parliament for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of Deputies to the ſame purpoſe in every County: and at laſt, by the Tumults which they raiſed, the Threats they uſed to divulge the names of the diſſenting Lords, and ſecret promiſes to ſome others (for Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> told the Earl of <hi>Dover, he muſt look for no Preferment unleſs he joyned with them</hi>) they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35342:53"/>prevailed upon the Houſe of Peers, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the moſt eminent were abſent, to joyn in a Petition for the <hi>Militia,</hi> upon pretence of great Dangers at home, and more prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious terrours from abroad, pretending that by Intelligence from <hi>Paris, Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> they were aſſured of great deſigns to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Parliament, together with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion; (whoſe fate and Intereſt they would have it imagined, was ſo twiſted with theirs, that like thoſe Twins they could not laugh nor grieve but in Conjunction.) This Paper being preſented to His Majeſty, whoſe Soul was wholly devoted to Peace, when it did not betray Religion and the Truſt Heaven had committed unto Him, He propoſes to them Expedients whereby they might be aſſociated with Him in the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> which Honour and Conſcience forbad Him to deveſt Himſelf wholly of, and paſſionately adjures them to lay aſide their vain and empty Terrours, whereby they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and divided the People, not ſuffering them to enjoy the Peace and Gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions wherein He had exceeded the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all His Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>But they, who had projected to themſelves the whole Power, would not be contented with a Partner in it, and therefore deſpiſing His Indulgence, and neglecting His Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35342:54"/>the next day in furious Votes declared themſelves ſole Maſters of the <hi>Militia:</hi> and to make the People believe there was truth in their falſe Fears, they command ſtrict Watches to be kept in all ſuſpected places, Beacons to be new ſet up, the Sea marks to be watched, and the Navy to be new rigged and fitted for the Sea. New Plots were alſo diſcovered, and Strange and unheard-of Counſels to murder the moſt Eminent Patriots are brought to light. <hi>A Taylor in a ditch hears ſome deſperate Cavaliers contriving the Death of Mr.</hi> Pym. <hi>A Plaiſter alſo taken from a Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore was ſent into the Houſe to the ſame perſon, that the Infection firſt ſeiſing on a Member of the quickeſt ſenſes, might thence more impetuouſly diffuſe it ſelf upon all the moſt Grave Senators.</hi> Such like Plots as theſe, and whatſoever could be deviſed, were publiſhed to make the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar think thoſe demands of the Faction ſeem modeſt, (their dangers being ſo great) which were very unjuſt.</p>
            <p>And leſt the <hi>King</hi> ſhould at His coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the North make uſe of that Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> (which at His own Charges He had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Expedition) for His own defence, the Faction, to ſecure that and the Town for their future purpoſes, ſend down Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> without any Order or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from either Houſe of Parliament, to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35342:54"/>ſeiſe on them. This Man of a fury and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence equal to their Commands, when the <hi>King,</hi> petitioned by the Gentlemen of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> to employ thoſe Arms and that Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Safety and Peace of that County, (where ſome of the Factious Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had begun to form the like Seditions with thoſe of <hi>London,</hi>) would have entred <hi>Hull,</hi> [<hi>Anno</hi> 1642.] <hi>April</hi> 23. inſolently ſhut the Gates upon Him, and would not permit Him, though with but twenty Attendants, for He offered to leave the Guard of Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen which followed Him without. The <hi>King</hi> thereupon proclaims him Traytor, and by Letters complains of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, and requires Satisfaction. But the Faction rendred the Act ſo glorious, that the Houſe of Commons by their Votes approved what he had done without their Command, and clamored that the <hi>King</hi> had done them an injury, in proclaiming ſo innocent a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Traytor: Ordered the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to whom they had committed the Command of the Navy, to land ſome men out of the Ships at <hi>Hull,</hi> and to tranſport the Magazine there from thence to <hi>London.</hi> An Order of Aſſiſtance was alſo given to ſeveral of their Confidents, as a Committee of both Houſes to reſide at <hi>Hull,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> were commanded to execute their commands. Beſides, they ſent a Commiſſion
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35342:55"/>to <hi>Hotham</hi> to proſecute the Inſolencies he had begun, and kindle that War which took fire on the whole Nation, and in a ſhort ſpace conſumed him and his Son, who were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Inſtructors of his Villany: For he fell under that ſame Fate which attends all the Inſtruments of Great Crimes, to be Odious and ſuſpected by thoſe that made uſe of them. Therefore they gave ſuch a power to the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire</hi> as did conclude the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, and ſubmiſſion of <hi>Hotham</hi> to His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. This cauſed him to reflect with grief and madneſs upon his firſt miniſtery to the Faction, which appeared every day more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous to his Conſcience, being now ſpoiled of that Grandeur that he hoped would have been its reward, and awakened by thoſe Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in the whole Kingdom which followed it, and were but as the Copies of his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Treaſon. Therefore he thought to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his former guilt by ſurrendring the Town to Him from whom he had detained it. But his practices were diſcovered to the Faction by One whom they had ſent thither in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to preach the Goſpel, but in truth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to ſearch into the intrigues of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: ſo that he periſhed in his deſign being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtout nor wiſe enough in juſt enterpriſes, nor of a pertinacy ſufficient for a proſperous Perfidiouſneſs. And although in his Ruine the <hi>King</hi> obſerved how great a draught was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35342:55"/>to the higheſt thirſt of Revenge, yet He did truly bewail him: and indeed he was ſo much the more to be pitied, becauſe his cruel Maſters deluded him to a ſilence of their black Secrets with a falſe hope of Life till the Ax was upon his Neck. So betraying his Soul to a ſurpriſe by his Spiritual enemies as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Spiritual Guides had done his Body to them.</p>
            <p>The Inſolency of <hi>Hotham,</hi> who acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Inſtructions and late Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beginning acts not uſual in Peace, nor juſtifiable by Law, (for he iſſued out War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants for the Trained Bands to march into <hi>Hull</hi> with their Arms, where he forced them to leave them, and nakedly return to their homes, that ſo they might be obnoxious to his Violence) and the practices of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee which were ſent down into the North, to debauch the People in their Loyalty, made the <hi>King</hi> intend His own Security by a Guard; which the Gentry and Commonalty of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> that were witneſſes of the Injury of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to their Prince, did willingly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily make up. No ſooner had the <hi>King</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed His intention of ſuch a Guard, but the Faction, who were watchful of all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of beginning a War, and ingaging thoſe that either through Fear or Weakneſs had hitherto ſubmitted to their Impoſtures in a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35342:56"/>more obliging guilt, (for now the greateſt part of the Peers, who were of the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Families and Nobleſt Fortunes, and a very great number of the Houſe of Commons, Perſons of juſt hopes and fair Eſtates, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the deſigns of the Diſturbers, ſcorned any longer to be their Slaves, yet not thinking it ſafe to provoke the fury of the Vulgar Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults by a preſent oppoſition, had withdrawn from the Parliament to follow the <hi>King</hi> and His Fortune, and every day ſome more were ſtill falling off) took this occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence our Miſeries, and open thoſe Sluces of Blood which polluted the whole Kingdom. For upon the firſt Intelligence of it they fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Houſe of Commons and the City with Clamors, That <hi>His Majeſty had now taken Arms to the overthrow of them and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion;</hi> and that <hi>they were not any longer to think the Happineſs of the Kingdom did depend upon the</hi> King, <hi>or any of the Regal Branches of that Stock; that it would argue no want either of Duty or Modeſty, if they ſhould depoſe Him.</hi> By theſe Harangues they ſo heated the Parliament, that was now more penurious than before in perſons of Honour and Conſcience, to ſuch a degree of Fury, that unmindful how they themſelves for eight months before upon impoſſible Fears and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Jealouſies had taken a Guard, they Reſolved upon the Queſtion, that the <hi>King
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35342:56"/>by taking to himſelf ſuch a Guard did intend to levy War againſt the Parliament.</hi> With an equal fury they iſſue out Commiſſions into all parts of the Kingdom, and appoint certain days for all the Trained Bands to be put into a poſture of War, ſending down ſome of their Members to ſee to the execution of theſe Commands, and to ſeiſe on the Magazines in the ſeveral Counties.</p>
            <p>To all theſe their violent and unjuſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts the <hi>King</hi> firſt oppoſes the Law, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Declarations manifeſts the Power of Arms to be the Ancient and undoubted Right of the Crown, by many Proclamations, charges all Men under the Crime and Penalties of Treaſon to forbear the Execution of thoſe Ordinances which were publiſhed to Licence their Rebellion, and Anſwers with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Diligence and Eloquence all the fictitious Pretenſions of the Parliament to that Power, in their ſeveral Remonſtrances. But though the <hi>King</hi> had in the judgment of all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and unintereſſed perſons the Juſter Cauſe, and the more powerful Pen, yet the Faction's <hi>Haſte, which is moſt efficacious in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Diſcords,</hi> the Slanders they had raiſed of Him, and impreſſed in the minds of the People, the terrours of that Arbitrary Power which the Houſe of Commons had a long while exerciſed in the vexatious proſecution
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35342:57"/>of all ſuch as did oppoſe their imperious Reſolves, (for they would by their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers ſend for the Great Earls and Prime Barons of the Kingdom as Rogues and Felons, and weary them and others with a tedious and chargeable Attendance, oppreſs them with heavy and unproportionable Cenſures, and reſtrain them by Illegal Impriſonments) and the hopes of licence and ſpoil in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of Church and State, had ſo preoccupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Minds of the inferiour Multitude, that neither Law nor Religion could have the leaſt conſideration in their practices; and thoſe Perſons whom His Majeſty appointed as Commiſſioners of <hi>Array,</hi> in few places found that Obedience which was due to the juſt Commands of a Gracious Prince, who vainly expected that Reverence to Juſtice in others which Himſelf gave.</p>
            <p>After the experience of their Power in theſe their Succeſſes at Land, and having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the whole Navy at Sea, being made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the moſt and greateſt Strengths of the Kingdom, they then thought it might be ſafe for them to publiſh the aims and ends of their moſt deſtructive deſigns; which if ſooner manifeſted, when the <hi>King</hi> by His Meſſage of 20. of <hi>January</hi> from <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them <hi>to preſcribe the limits of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, give full Boundaries to His own Power,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35342:57"/>and propoſe what was in their judgements proper to make the People happy; and moſt religiouſly promiſed an equal tenderneſs of theirs and the Peoples Rights as of His own, and what was for the Publick Good ſhould not be obſtructed for His Particular emolument;</hi> they had juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn upon themſelves all that popular hatred which they endeavoured to fling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>King,</hi> and had been buried under thoſe ruines which they projected for the Grave of Majeſty. But then the Faction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided not ſo much in their own force, nor were the Vulgar then ſo blinded with fury as to chuſe their own Deſtruction: and therefore to that Meſſage of Peace nothing was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but Complaints, That <hi>by ſuch Adviſoes their Counſels were diſturbed, that it was contrary to their unbounded Privileges to be minded of what was neceſſary.</hi> But now they were furniſhed with a Power equal to their Ambition, they thought it expedient to confirm their newly-gotten Empire with ſome pretenſions to Peace; but with a great deal of Caution, that the affectation of it might not diſappoint them of their hopes, which were all built upon War and Confuſion. Therefore they formed the Conditions ſuch as the <hi>King</hi> could not in Honour or Conſcience grant them, nor expect Peace by them. Or if He did, they ſhould be inſtated in ſuch a Grandeur, that they might reap for themſelves all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35342:58"/>Honours and unlawful gains of an Arbitrary Power, the thing they aimed at, and leave the <hi>King</hi> overwhelmed with ſhame and contempt for their miſcarriages in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Theſe Conditions were digeſted into Nineteeen Propoſitions; which when preſented to the <hi>King,</hi> He ſaw by an aſſent to them He ſhould be concluded to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Himſelf, and be but as an helpleſs and idle Spectator of the Miſeries ſuch Tyrants would bring upon the People whom God had committed to His Truſt. Therefore He gave them that denial which they really deſired and expected, and adjuſts His refuſal in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, wherein He ſets forth the Injuſtice of each Propoſition. His Anſwer He ſent by the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford</hi> and Earl of <hi>South-hampton,</hi> Perſons of great Integrity and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with Inſtructions to Treat in the Houſe of Peers upon more equal Conditions.</p>
            <p>But it behoved the Faction not to let the Kingdom ſee any way to Peace, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any admittance to thoſe Lords, before ever the <hi>King</hi>'s Anſwer could publickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover who were the obſtructours of the Peoples quiet, they Ordered a Collection to be made of Money and Plate, to maintain Horſe, Horſe-men and Arms for the enſuing War. The ſpecious Pretences for which were <hi>the Safety of the King's Perſon, and the taking
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35342:58"/>Him out of the hands of Evil Counſellors, the Defence of the Priviledges of Parliament, the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the maintenance of the Ancient Laws of the Land.</hi> Such inviting cauſes as theſe inflamed the Minds of the Multitude, and filled them with more airy hopes of Victory than the noiſe of Drums and Trumpets: But that which was moſt powerful were the Sermons of ſuch who, being diſpleaſed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eccleſiaſtical Government, were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the richeſt Benefices, and a partage of the Revenues which belonged to Biſhops, Deans and Chapiters. Theſe from their Pulpits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed War in the Name of Chriſt the Prince of Peace, and whatſoever was contributed to the ſpilling of the blood of the Wicked, was to build up the Throne of the meekeſt lamb; and beſides the ſatisfaction they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the Publick Faith, which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament promiſed, there was a larger Intereſt to be doubled upon them in the Kingdom of Saints that was now approaching. Deluded by theſe Artifices and Impoſtures, People of all Conditions and all Sexes, ſome carried by a ſecret Inſtinct, others hurried by ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Zeal, and a laſt ſort led by Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, caſt into this Holy Treaſury the Banck for Blood, all the Ornaments of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all their Silver Veſſels, even to their Spoons, with the Pledges of their firſt Love,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35342:59"/>their Marriage-rings; and the younger Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males ſpared not their Thimbles and Bodkins, the obliging Gifts of their <hi>Inamorato</hi>'s, from being a part of the Price of Blood. But while theſe Preparations were made at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>York</hi> Declares againſt the Scandal, that <hi>He intended to Levy War againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> calling God to witneſs how far His deſires and thoughts were from it; and alſo thoſe many Lords who were witneſſes of His Counſels and Actions, do publiſh to the World by a Writing ſubſcribed with all their Names, to the number of Forty and odd, that <hi>they ſaw not any colour of Preparations or Counſels that might reaſonably beget the belief of any ſuch Deſign, and were fully perſwaded that He had no ſuch intention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all was in vain, for the Faction choſe that the People ſhould be rather guilty of committing Rebellion, than only of favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Contrivers of it, and decreed to try whether by a proſperous Succeſs they could change their Crimes to Vertue. Therefore they haſtened all they could to raiſe Horſe and Foot to form an Army equal to their Uſurpation: which was not difficult for them to do, for they being Maſters of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Multitudes deſirous of Novelty were eaſily amaſſed for any enterpriſe, eſpecially when the entring into this Warfare might
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35342:59"/>make the Servant freer than his Maſter, (for ſuch was the Licence was indulged to thoſe Youths that would ſerve the Cauſe) 20000 were ſooner gathered than the <hi>King</hi> could get 500. The City alſo could afford them more Ordnance than the <hi>King</hi> could promiſe to Himſelf common Muskets: and to pay their Souldiers, beſides the vaſt ſumms that were gathered for <hi>Ireland</hi> (which though they by their own Act had decreed ſhould not be uſed for any other enterpriſe, yet now diſpence with their Faith, and imploy it to make <hi>England</hi> as miſerable as that Iſland) and the Contributions of the deluded ſouls for this War; they ſeiſed alſo upon the Revenues of the <hi>King, Queen, Prince,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and plunder the Houſes of thoſe Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen whom they ſuſpected to be Favourers of the <hi>King</hi>'s Cauſe. And in contemplation of theſe advantages, they promiſed their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous party an undoubted Victory, and to lead Majeſty Captive in Triumph through <hi>London</hi> within a Month, by the Conduct of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom they appointed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>Thus did they drive that Juſt and Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Prince</hi> to ſeek His Safety by neceſſary Arms, ſince nothing worſe could befal Him after a ſtout, though unhappy, Reſiſtance than He was to hope for in a tame Submiſſion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35342:60"/>to their Violence. Therefore though He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly abhorred thoſe Sins which are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of War, yet He wanted not Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to attempt at Victory, notwithſtanding it ſeemed almoſt impoſſible againſt ſo well-appointed an Enemy. Therefore with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible diligence moving from place to place, from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> from thence to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the Confines of <hi>Wales,</hi> by diſcovering thoſe Abilities with which His Soul was richly fraught unto His deluded Subjects, He appeared not only worthy of their Reverence, but of their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes for His Defence; and in all places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Good with His Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exciting the Fearful by His Example, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the Imperfections of His Friends, but always praiſing their Vertues, He ſo prevailed upon thoſe who were not men of many Times, nor by a former Guilt debauch'd to Inhumanity, that He had quickly contracted an Army greater than His Enemies expected, and which was every day increaſed by thoſe Lords and Gentlemen who refuſed to be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted any longer with the practices of the Faction by ſitting among them, and being Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of large Fortunes had raiſed their Friends and Tenants to ſuccour that Majeſty that now laboured under an Eclipſe. Moſt men being moved with Pity and Shame to ſee their Prince, whoſe former Reign had made them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35342:60"/>wanton in Plenty, to be driven from His own Palaces, and concluded under a want of Bread, to be neceſſitated to implore their aid, for the preſervation of His and their Rights. So that notwithſtanding all the Impoſtures of the Faction and the Corruptions of the Age, there were many great Examples of Loyalty and Vertue. Many Noble Perſons did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoveriſh themſelves to ſupply the <hi>King</hi> with Men and Money. Some Private men made their way through numerous dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to joyn with, and fight under his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Many great Ladies and Vertuous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons parted with the Ornaments of their Sex to relieve His wants, and ſome bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their Houſes in His Cauſe when their Lords were otherwhere ſeeking Honour in his Service. Both the Univerſities freely devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Plate to ſuccour their Prince, the Supreme Patron and Incourager of all Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Queen pawned Her Jewels to provide Neceſſaries for the Safety of Her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Which Duty of Hers, though it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Honour of all Ages, was brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Demagogues with the imputation of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>This ſudden and unexpected growth of the Strength of the <hi>King</hi> after ſo many years of Slanders, and ſuch induſtrious Plots to make Him odious and Contemptible, raiſed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35342:61"/>the admiration of all men, and the fears of that credulous Party who had given up their Faith to the Faction, when they repreſented the <hi>King</hi> guilty of ſo much Folly and Vice (and ſome corrupted Citizens had repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Him as a Prodigy of both in a Scene at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> an Art uſed by Jeſuites to impreſs more deeply a Calumny,) that they could not imagine any perſon of Prudence or Conſcience would appear in His Service, and they expected every day when, deſerted by all as a Monſter, He ſhould in Chains deliver Himſelf up to the Commands of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q>Some attributed this ſtrange increaſe in power to <hi>the natural Affection of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to their Lawful Soveraign, from whom though the Arts and Impulſes of Seditious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues may a while eſtrange and divorce their minds, yet their Genius will irreſiſtibly at laſt force them to their firſt Love;</hi> and therefore they urged the ſaying of that Obſerving States-man, that <hi>if the Crown of</hi> England <hi>were placed but on an Hedge-ſtake, he would be on that ſide where the Crown was.</hi> Others referred it to the full evidence of the wickedneſs of His Adverſaries, for their Counſels were now diſcovered, and their Ends manifeſt, not to maintain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Liberty, which was equally hateful to them as Tyranny when it was not in their hands, but to acquire a Grandeur and Power
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35342:61"/>that might ſecure and adminiſter to their Luſts: and it was now every where pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed what Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> Anſwered to one who inquired <hi>What they did expect from the</hi> King; he replyed, <hi>That He ſhould commit Himſelf and all that is His to our Care.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſcribed it to the fears of ruine to thoſe numerous Families and Myriads of people which the change of Government deſigned by the Parliament muſt neceſſarily effect. But this, though it argued that <hi>Cauſe exceeding bad by which ſo great a part of a Community is utterly deſtroyed, without any abſolute neceſſity for preſerving the whole;</hi> yet made but an inconſiderable Addition to the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe greateſt Power was built upon Perſons of the Nobleſt Extract and the faireſt Eſtates in <hi>England,</hi> of which they could not eaſily ſuſpect to be deveſted without an abſolute overthrow of all the Laws of Right and Wrong, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs was to be feared by their invaſions on the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt undoubted Rights. For <hi>when Majeſty it ſelf is aſſaulted, there can be no ſecurity for private Fortunes; and thoſe that decline upon deſign from the paths of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity will never reſt till they come to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Injuſtice;</hi> as theſe afterwards did. Beſides thoſe that imputed the ſpeedy amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe Forces to the Equity of the <hi>King</hi>'s Cauſe, His moſt Powerful Eloquence,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35342:62"/>Indefatigable Induſtry, and moſt Oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Converſe; there were another ſort that ſuſpending their Judgements till all the Scenes of War were paſſed, reſolved all into the Providence of God: Who though He were pleaſed to ſingle Him out of all the Kings of the Earth as the fitteſt Champion to wreſtle with Adverſity, and to make Him glorious by <hi>Sufferings,</hi> which <hi>being well born truly prove men Great;</hi> yet would He furniſh Him (almoſt by a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) likewiſe with ſuch Advantages, in the conduct of which His Prudence and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity might evidence that He did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Proſperity, and by clearing up even this way His eminent Vertues, warn the following Ages from a Credulity to unquiet Perſons, ſince the beſt of Princes was thus infamouſly ſlandered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From all theſe concurring Cauſes, each one in their Way and Order, did the <hi>King's</hi> ſtrength ſo far increaſe, as that He won many Battels, and was not far from Conqueſt in the Whole War; had not God ſeen fit to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict this ſinful Nation with Numerous and moſt Impious Tyrants, and make us feel, that <hi>no Oppreſſions are ſo unſupportable as thoſe which are impoſed by ſuch as have made the higheſt Pretenſions to Liberty:</hi> of which we had bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter experience after the War was finiſhed that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35342:62"/>was now begun. For there had been ſome ſlight Conflicts e're this in the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties betwixt the Commiſſioners of <hi>Array</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi> with various Succeſſes; which require juſt Volumes and compleat Hiſtories to relate, and cannot be comprehended in the ſhort View of the <hi>King</hi>'s Life, where it is only intended to ſpeak of thoſe Battels in which the King in Perſon gave ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of His Wiſdom and Valour. The firſt of which was at <hi>Edge-Hill</hi> on <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. For the <hi>King</hi> had no ſooner gotten a conſiderable Force, though not equal to thoſe of His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but He marched towards <hi>London,</hi> and in His way thither met with <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army that were come from thence to take Him. The <hi>King</hi> having viewed their Army by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective-glaſs from the top of that Hill, and being asked afterwards by His Officers what He meant to do, <hi>To give them battel</hi> (ſaid He with a preſent Courage) <hi>it is the firſt time I ever ſaw the Rebels in a body: God, and good mens Prayers to Him, aſſiſt the Justice of My Cauſe:</hi> and immediately prepared for the Fight; which was acted with ſuch a fury, that near 6000 (according to the common Account, but ſome ſay a far leſs number) were ſlain upon the place. Night concluded this Battel, which had comprehended the whole War, had not the <hi>King</hi>'s prevailing Horſe preferr'd the Spoils to Victory, and left the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35342:63"/>Enemy ſome advantage to diſpute for her. But the <hi>King</hi> had all the faireſt marks of her favour. For though He had loſt His General, yet He kept the Field, poſſeſſed the dead Bodies, opened His way toward <hi>London,</hi> and in the ſight of ſome part of the Army of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> (who accounted it a Victory that He was not totally routed and killed,) took <hi>Banbury,</hi> and entred Triumphantly into <hi>Oxford</hi> (which He had deſigned for His Winter-quarters) with 150 Colours taken in fight. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſured that place, He advances towards <hi>London,</hi> whither <hi>Eſſex</hi> had gotten before Him, and diſpoſed his baffled Regiments within ten miles of the City; yet the <hi>King</hi> fell upon two Regiments of them at <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> took 500 Priſoners, and ſunk their Ordnance. From thence intending to draw nearer <hi>London,</hi> He had intelligence, that the <hi>City</hi> had poured forth all their Auxiliaries to re-inforce <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Troops; to which being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to oppoſe His Souldiers wearied with their March, nor thinking it ſafe to force an Enemy to fight upon <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> which <hi>inſpires a more than Ordinary Fury,</hi> He retreats to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> having taught His Enemies, that He was not eaſily to be Overcome.</p>
            <p>For in the management of this Battel, He did not only undeceive the abuſed world of thoſe Slanders which His Enemies had pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35342:63"/>Him with, but He exceeded that Opinion His own Party had of His Abilities. And though He parted from <hi>London</hi> altogether unexperienced in Martial affairs, yet at <hi>Edge-Hill</hi> He appeared a moſt Excellent Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. His Valour was alſo equal to His Prudence, and He could as well endure Labours as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Dangers. And by a communication of toils, encouraged His Souldiers to keep the Field all the night, when they ſaw He refuſed the refreſhments of a Bed; for He ſought no other Shelter from the injuries of the Air than His own Coach. Theſe Vertues and this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs made ſuch an impreſſion on the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that though they took all courſes to hide the Infamy of their worſted Army, yet in more humble Expreſſions than formerly they Petitioned the <hi>King</hi> for a Treaty of Peace, which His Majeſty very earneſtly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.

Encouraged by this they form their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions like the Commands of Conquerours, and ſo ſtreighten the Power and Time of their Commiſſioners, that the Treaty at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> became fruitleſs, which there had taken up all the <hi>King</hi>'s employment this Winter, though abroad His Forces were buſie in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1643.] At the opening of the Spring the Queen comes back to <hi>England,</hi> bringing with Her ſome conſiderable Supplies of Men, Money and Ammunition, and Her coming was entertained with ſuch a Series of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, that the <hi>King</hi> that Summer was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the North and Weſt, except ſome few Garriſons. Which ſo diſmayed the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that very many of them were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to quit the Kingdom: and had the <hi>King</hi> followed His own Counſels, to march imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately towards <hi>London,</hi> and not been fatally over-born at a Council of War, (which, it is ſaid, His Enemies at <hi>London</hi> did aſſure their Party would ſo be) firſt to attempt <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> He had, in the jugment of all diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, then finiſhed the War with Glory. But here He lay ſo long till <hi>Eſſex</hi> had gotten a Recruit from <hi>London,</hi> and came time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to relieve the Town; though in his return the <hi>King</hi> neceſſitated him to fight, worſted him near <hi>Newbery,</hi> and ſo bravely followed him the next day, that He forced the Parliaments Horſe which were left in the Reer to ſeek their ſafety by making their way over a great part of their Foot; yet loſt on His ſide much Noble Blood, as the Earls of <hi>Carnarvan</hi> and <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:35342:64"/>This laſt was lamented by all, being equally dexterous at the Pen and Sword, had won ſome Wreathes in thoſe Controverſies that were to be managed by Reaſon, and was eminent in all the Generous parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, above any of his Fortune and Dignity. After this Encounter the <hi>King</hi> returns to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> to Conſult with thoſe Members of both Houſes that had left the Impoſtures and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults at <hi>London,</hi> to joyn with Him for the common benefit, who being as to the Peers the far greater, and as to the Commons an equal Number with thoſe at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Name and Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deliberated of the ways of Peace, and means to prevent the Deſolations which the Faction ſo furiouſly deſigned, who were now reſolving to encreaſe our Miſeries by Calling in the <hi>Scots</hi> to their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>For though they pretended ſo highly to God's Cauſe, as if they had the certainty of ſome Divine Revelation, yet they would not truſt Him for their Preſervation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their pretences to his Cauſe had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with ſo vaſt a Treaſure and ſo mighty a Strength; but would invite others to the Violation of moſt ſacred Oaths, to ſin againſt all Laws and every Rule of Juſtice, that themſelves might be ſecure in their Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations. And that Perfidious Party that then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35342:65"/>ruled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> hoping for as great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages as their former Wickedneſs had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, contrary to all Obligations which the <hi>King</hi>'s Goodneſs had laid on them, and their free and Voluntary Execrations, (as was that of <hi>Alexander Leſley,</hi> who lifting up his arms and hands to Heaven, wiſhed <hi>they might rot to his body before he died, if ever he ſhould heave them up hereafter, or draw his ſword, againſt ſo gude a King,</hi>) drew that People once more into Rebellion againſt their Prince; and to make them more eager, and think the Enterpriſe eaſie, they firſt raiſed a report that the <hi>King</hi> was deſerted by moſt of His Nobility.</p>
            <p>The Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> having by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moved the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to endeavour Peace, did alſo declare againſt this Invaſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> by another Letter ſent to them, in which alſo they acquaint them with the falſeneſs of their officious Lie, and ſhew how inconſiderable a Number of Lords were with thoſe that invited them in. The <hi>King</hi> Himſelf writes alſo to put them in mind of their ſeveral Ingagements to be Quiet. But with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie fit for moſt perjured Souls, they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Letters to be burned by the hand of the Hangman. A more ſecret falſhood He alſo found in the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> whoſe Treaſons now came to be more ſuſpected.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35342:65"/>For His Majeſty having written to him, to uſe all his Power and Intereſt to keep his Country-men at home, (which had not been difficult for one of his Grandeur in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Nation) he by ſome ſecret Arts doth more inflame them; and to cover his Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, flies from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as ſeeking a ſhelter for his Loyalty; but indeed to be a Spy in the <hi>King</hi>'s Counſels. But his Treaſons had out-ſtripp'd him and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> who came with him, therefore they were both forbidden the Court. <hi>Lanerick</hi> not willing to tarry till a further Diſcovery, gets out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> flies to thoſe at <hi>London,</hi> and by them was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army; which made <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Treachery more evident, and he was ſent Priſoner to <hi>Pendennis</hi> Caſtle. But the diſhonour of that Nation was in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure repaired by the Gallantry and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Marqueſs <hi>Montroſs,</hi> who being commiſſion'd by the <hi>King,</hi> with an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Induſtry by ſmall numbers of men won many Battels, and overthrew well-formed Armies: and had not the Fate of his Maſter, which was to be betrayed by thoſe He truſted, been likewiſe common to him, he had forced that Nation to Juſtice and Quiet.</p>
            <p>But e're <hi>Montroſs</hi> could get his Commiſſion, the <hi>Scots</hi> were entred <hi>England:</hi> whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35342:66"/>that it might be leſs odious to the People, who now grew cold in their zeal to the Cauſe, and ſaw themſelves deluded into ſo continued dangers, the Faction make uſe of ſuch frauds as ſhould make the People either think them neceſſary aſſiſtances, or might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their thoughts from apprehending the Miſeries they brought with them to this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore they invent new Slanders of the <hi>King</hi> and His Party. <hi>That His Majeſty did intend to tranſlate Monarchy into a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: that He would ſeiſe upon all their Eſtates who had any way oppoſed Him, and make their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Slaves: that there was no hope of Pardon from Him, who was ſo mercileſs: that He would take away all their Liberties and Privileges <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> forfeited, deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, and introduce Popery, which at</hi> Oxford <hi>He did practiſe Himſelf, and that all men muſt be forced to go to Maſs.</hi> As for His Party they ſet them out to be ſuch Monſters, that the lower ſort of People doubted whether the Cavaliers had the ſhapes of men. For ſad Relations were printed and publiſhed of their inhumanity and barbarous murders: that <hi>they did feaſt upon the Fleſh of Men, and that they fed their Dogs and their Horſes with the ſame Diet, to make them more fierce for the blood of the Godly Party: that no mans houſe was ſo poor and mean that a Cavalier would think beneath his rapine.</hi> Thus they wrought upon the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35342:66"/>ſpirits of ſome by fear. For thoſe of a moroſe and cholerick temper they had proper divertiſements: they permitted to them a tumultuary Reformation, to pull down the Pictures and Images of Chriſt, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Saints; which with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity they committed to the flames, that they might ſuffer as it were another Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All Croſſes, though ſet up for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Uſe in the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> and other places, they pulled down: they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Churches, and there deface what their Humour or Rapine would call Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pull down the Organs, tear the Surpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and all this was ſuffered to pleaſe the Rabble, who delight in violences and ſuch oſtentations of their fury, and to make them in ſomething or other guilty, that they might deſpair of Pardon.</p>
            <p>For others, who were to be wrought upon by Religion, they entertain them with Faſts, publick Thankſgivings for ſlight Victories, and ſolemn Spiritual meetings (as they called them;) where whatſoever the Faction dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was commended by the Speakers to their unwary hearers as the Oracles of Heaven: and being thus wrapp'd up in thoſe true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights which accompany the Worſhip of God, they were ſecurely ſwallowed by them, as Poiſon when it is offered in a Sacramental
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35342:67"/>Chalice. To pleaſe their Miniſters whom hitherto they had uſed as their Properties and Inſtruments of their Arts, Presbytery is ſet up, that they alſo might have an Imaginary Empire: but it was not intended they ſhould exerciſe it. For the pretenſions of that to a <hi>Divine Right</hi> did ſo terrifie them who were reſolved againſt all Government that was not ſubject unto or dependent on theirs, that they preſently raiſed all the other Sects, <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Eraſtians,</hi> (who for the moſt part were Lawyers, that could not endure to hear of any Thunderbolts of Excommunication, but what was heated in their own forges) <hi>Anabaptists, Seekers,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> (of which there were many ſprung up, who ſeeing how Religion was abuſed to carnal and unjuſt Ends, began firſt to deſpiſe that, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to deny God) to write and declaim againſt this new Politie, as the moſt ſevere and abſolute Tyranny under the Sun, and the tenth Perſecution. But this ſeeming mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of admitting a Church-Government ſerved their ends for the preſent, till they could acquire a greater ſtrength, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of which they might ſlight the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Law, and the Anathema's of the Church. The Liturgy alſo was aboliſhed, under pretence of a Spiritual Liberty, for it was accuſed of putting a reſtraint upon the Spirit, but in truth, becauſe it had ſo frequent
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35342:67"/>Offices for the <hi>King.</hi> To theſe were added the Covenant, the Fetters of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: this was to bind the whole Nation to the Intereſts of the Faction, and was uſed as the <hi>Water of Jealouſie,</hi> to diſcover thoſe whom they did ſuſpect. Therefore all the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, of what Sect ſoever, whether Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents or Anabaptiſts, though they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take it themſelves, (becauſe it did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to the Preſervation of the <hi>King</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Authority) yet were as eager Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it as the Presbyterians (who in ſimplicity urged it as the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their Empire) upon all who they thought would not proſtitute their Souls to their deſigns, or had any thing fit to be made their Spoils. And by this only Engine many thouſand Perſons and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were miſerably ruined, eſpecially of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>To oblige more faſtly thoſe that had no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to expect nor hopes to receive any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their Service againſt their <hi>Prince</hi> in the other life, and ſo would not be ſatisfied with the ſhews of Religion, but ſought more ſolid encouragements in the ſpoils of it, the Lands of the Biſhops were expoſed to ſale, and that at ſuch eaſie rates as might invite the hazards of the Purchace, ſatiate their bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Covetouſneſs, and ingage them in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35342:68"/>faith to their Merchants. To cement all theſe diſtinct Humours in one common pleaſure, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was prepared for a Sacrifice, and about this time began his Tryal, which continued a whole year, being when the Houſes were at leiſure called by ſeveral months and weeks to anſwer to his Charge, that by his frequent paſſages as a Priſoner he might give a pleaſant Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Rabble, who are delighted with the ruines and misfortunes of great Perſons,</hi> and by their injuries and reproaches he might be reduced to ſuch a weakneſs of Spirit as was not competent with the defence of his Cauſe. But his Cauſe and his Conſcience were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, and he overthrew their Slanders, though he could not their Power.</p>
            <p>By theſe Arts and Ways was the Winter ſpent to prepare for the attempts of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Summer, wherein, [<hi>Anno</hi> 1644] though the Parliaments Forces increaſed by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Succours had the Succeſs over ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bodies of the Royaliſts, yet that ſmall Number that followed the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon, and were guided by His own Counſels and Example, obtained two great Victories. For His Majeſty having once more provided for the Safety of the Queen, (in ſending Her to <hi>Excester,</hi> there to lay down the burden of Her Love, and from thence to ſeek for Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:35342:68"/>in <hi>France</hi>) taken (contrary to their hopes) His laſt farewel of Her, and left <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> ſtrengthened againſt the Siege which the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Sir <hi>Willian Waller</hi> threatned that place with, He with a ſmall party draws out, intending to form His Counſels accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the future Occurrences. This made the Enemy divide, and <hi>Eſſex</hi> was deſigned to reduce the Weſt. But <hi>Waller,</hi> with whom uſually went Sir <hi>Arthur Heſilrigge</hi> (a Perſon fitter to raiſe Seditious Tumults than manage Armies) was to hunt the <hi>King</hi> upon the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> towards which He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to direct His courſe. But hearing of the reſolutions of theſe two jealous Generals, He wheels about to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and from thence drew the greateſt ſtrength of that Garriſon, and with that falling upon <hi>Waller</hi> at <hi>Cropredy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> obtained a great Victory; which would have been more prejudicial to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, had not the Tenderneſs of His Subjects Blood reſtrained Him from proſecuting His Succeſs to a greater ſlaughter. But content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Himſelf to have diverted Injuries from His own breaſt, He only uſed this Victory for an advantage to Peace, which in a Letter from <hi>Eveſham, July</hi> 4. He moves the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto.</p>
            <p>But the unquiet Criminals rendred it vain and fruitleſs, and repreſented to the People
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35342:69"/>their yet prevailing Forces in the North, and their Army in the Weſt, which had now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſome conſiderable places to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Therefore to remove their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Power, the <hi>King</hi> follows him, and ſo cloſely purſues him, that He drove him up into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and there did as it were beſiege him. During which He ſent a Letter to him, which was ſeconded by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Lords and Gentlemen in His Army, to ſolicite His endeavours for the Peace and Quiet of the bleeding and waſted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But it met not its deſired effect: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Earl either valued not that ſolid Glory of being the happy Author of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Settlement; or ſeared that his paſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had wholly deſpoiled him of hopes of Security in a return to Obedience, or knew that his Authority was not ſo great to put an Iſſue to thoſe Crimes which he had led others to commit. <hi>(For every inconſiderable perſon may be powerfull at Diſturbances, but to form Peace requires much Wiſdom and great Vertues.)</hi> Which laſt was generally believed, for he had found and complained that his Credit declined with the Faction, that they were diſtruſtful leſt their own Arts might teach him to have no faith to them, becauſe he often ſolicited them to a compoſing of the Kingdoms Diſtractions. Therefore making no return to thoſe Letters, he provided for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35342:69"/>his own ſafety in a <hi>Cock-boat,</hi> and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſerted his Army; of which the Horſe, taking the advantage of a dark night, made their eſcape, but the Commanders of the Foot did capitulate for their Lives, and left their Arms, Cannon, Baggage and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the Diſpoſal of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſpeedy and prudent acquiſition of theſe two Victories ſhewed the <hi>King</hi> had thoſe Abilities that might have inſerted Him in the Catalogue of the Braveſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and had not want of Succeſs in His fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Enterpriſes clouded the Glory of this Summer, He had been as eminent among the Maſters of War as He was among the Sons of Peace, the Honour of which laſt He moſt eagerly thirſted, as rendering Him moſt like that Majeſty He did repreſent. Therefore after this Victory, by a Letter from <hi>Taveſtock, Sept.</hi> 8. He re-inforces that from <hi>Eveſham</hi> for an Accord with the Parliament, being not tranſported from His Lenity by the Violence with which Victory uſes to hurry humane breaſts to an inſolence. But He knew that <hi>Peace, though it is profitable to the Conquered, yet it is glorious for the Conquerour.</hi> To buſie His Army while He expected their Anſwer, and formed an Aſſociation in the Weſtern Counties, He ſits down before <hi>Plymmouth;</hi> but finding this Meſſage had an equal recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35342:70"/>with the former, and that the Faction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to ſacrifice their ill-acquired Power and Uſurped Intereſts to the publick Tranquillity, He riſes from thence, and marches towards <hi>London,</hi> from whence were by this time in the way to meet Him <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> recruited, and joyned with the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi>'s Forces that were now returned from their Northern Services. And at <hi>Newbery</hi> both ſides joyn in an eager Fight, which being varied with different ſucceſſes, in the ſeveral diviſions, each party draw off by degrees, and neither found cauſe to boaſt of a Victory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Parliament wearied with the Complaints of the oppreſſed Nation, who now grew impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent under the Diſtractions, take into Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration His Majeſty's two Meſſages for Peace, and ſend Propoſitions for it in the name of the two Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> united by Solemn League and Covenant. Which though they ſeemed the deſires of minds that intended nothing leſs than the common Tranquillity, yet the <hi>King</hi> neglects them not, but hoping that in a Treaty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners might argue them into Reaſon, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it, which with much difficulty the Houſes are drawn to accept; but yet would have it at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> a place but about fifteen miles
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:35342:70"/>diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> and above twice that diſtance from <hi>Oxford.</hi> And accordingly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from both Parties met on <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. While the <hi>King</hi> was providing for the Treaty, and forming Inſtructions for His Miniſters, the Faction found the Parliament other work by new deſigns; and to habituate the People to an abhorrency of Peace, fed them with blood. The two <hi>Hotham</hi>'s firſt were to be the Sport of the Multitude: and that the Father might have more than a ſingle death, he was drawn back in his journey to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31. that his Son might be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted before him, as he was <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. when after he had expreſſed his fury to thoſe Maſters whom they had ſerved to their ruines, his Head was chopt off. And on <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is brought to the place that was defiled with his Son's blood, and had his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it. Theſe were not much lamented by any, for the memory that they firſt kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the Flame of the Nation kept every eye dry.</p>
            <p>The People thus fed with courſer blood, a cleaner Sacrifice was afterwards preſented, <hi>Willam Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Primate</hi> of all <hi>England.</hi> He had indured Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment four years, and paſſed through a Tryal of many months, in which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf with ſuch a confidence as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:35342:71"/>the Innocency and Conſtancy of a Chriſtian Biſhop and Confeſſor, but yet muſt fall to pleaſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> and thoſe mercileſs men who imputed God's anger in the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Succeſs againſt their Prince, to the continuance of this Prelate's Life: therefore he was Voted Guilty of High Treaſon by the Houſe of Commons, and was condemned in the Houſe of Peers (though they have no power over the life of the meaneſt Subject without the concurrence of the <hi>King</hi>) when there were but Seven Lords preſent,<note place="margin">Some Writers (who ſince have been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their mis-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) have named amongſt thoſe Seven Lords, the Lord <hi>Bruce</hi> Earl of <hi>Elgin;</hi> but his Lordſhip upon the firſt notice of this report, did to ſeveral Perſons of Quality and Honour he converſed with, and ſince hath affirmed to me, that he was not then preſent, and that his heart could never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the ſhedding of the blood of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prelate.</note> and all thoſe not conſenting to the Murder, to be drawn, hanged and quartered. And this was the firſt Example of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Men by Votes, of killing by an Order of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, when there is no Law. It was moved (they ſay) by ſome that he might be ſhipp'd over to <hi>New-England,</hi> to die by the Contempt and Malice of thoſe People. But this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too great an Honour, becauſe it would make his end as his life was, much like that of the Primitive Biſhops, who for their Piety were baniſhed to Barbarous Coaſts, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Mines. Or elſe it would be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:35342:71"/>like an <hi>Athenian</hi> Oſtraciſm, and confeſs him too great and good to live among us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this motion was rejected; yet the Lords upon his Petition, to the diſtaſte of ſome Commons, changed the manner of that vile Execution to that more generous of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. To the Scaffold he was brought <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. after he had endured ſome affronts in his Antichamber in the Tower by ſome Sons of Schiſm and Sedition, who unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that morning he was preparing himſelf to appear before the great Biſhop of our Souls, would have him give ſome ſatisfaction to the Godly (for ſo they called themſelves) for his Perſecutions, (which he called Diſcipline.) To whom he Anſwered, <hi>That he was now ſhortly to give account of all his Actions at an higher and more equal Tribunal, and deſired he might not be diſturbed in his Preparations for it.</hi> When he came to the Scene of his death, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that chearfulneſs and ſerenity in his face, as a good Conſcience doth beautifie the owners with: and it was ſo conſpicuous, that his Enemies, who were aſhamed to ſee his Innocency pourtraied in his Countenance, did report he had drunk ſome Spirits, to force his nature from a paleneſs. He preached his own Funeral Sermon on that Text, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.2. and concluding his life with Prayer, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to the ſtroke of the Ax.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:35342:72"/>
            <p>
               <q>He was a Perſon of ſo great <hi>Abilities</hi> (which <hi>are the Deſignations of Nature to Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Command,</hi>) that they raiſed him from low beginnings to the higheſt Office the Proteſtant Profeſſion acknowledges in the Church. And he was equal to it. His Learning appear'd eminent in his Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and his Piety illuſtrious in his Diary (although publiſhed by One that was thirſty of his blood, and polluted with many malicious Comments and falſe Surmiſes to make him odious.) He was of ſo Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a Spirit, that both the Church and State have laſting Monuments of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous uſe of his Princes favour; at his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into which he dedicated all the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Emoluments of it to the Glory of God and the Good of Men, by a Projection of many noble Works: moſt of which he accompliſhed, and had finiſhed the reſt had not the Fate of the Nation checked the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his Deſigns, and cut off the Courſe of his Life. He was not contented by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only to ſerve his Generation, (for ſo he might have appeared more greedy of Fame, than deſirous of the Univerſal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit) but he endeavoured to render all others as heroick, if they aimed at a Capacity for his Friendſhip: for (I have heard it from his Enemies) no great man was admitted
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:35342:72"/>to a confidence and reſpect with him, unleſs he made his addreſs by ſome Act that was for the Common Good, or for the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Glory of the Proteſtant Faith. Learned men had not a better Friend, nor Learning it ſelf a greater Advancer; he ſearched all the Libraries of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and from ſeveral parts of the World purchaſed all the Ornaments and Helps of Literature he could, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church might have (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) by his Care as many Advantages for Knowledge as almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> did contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Grandeur of that of <hi>Rome.</hi> The outward Splendour of the Clergy was not more his Care than their Honour by a grave and pious Converſation; he would put them into a power of doing more good, but was ſevere againſt their Vices and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. He ſcorned a private Treaſure, and his Kindred were rather relieved than raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any greatneſs by him. In his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Friends, he was determinated to the Good and Wiſe, and ſuch as had both Parts and Deſires to profit the Church had his cloſeſt Embraces; if otherwiſe it happened, their frauds, not his choice, deſerved the blame. Both Papiſts and Sectaries were equally his Enemies, one party feared, and the other hated his Vertues. Some cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him of too much Heat, and a Zeal for Diſcipline above the Patience of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:35342:73"/>Times. But his greateſt unhappineſs, was, that he lived in a Factious Age, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt State, and under ſuch a Prince, whoſe Vertues not admitting an immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for Accuſations, was to be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe whom He did Careſſe. But when Faction and Malice are worn out by time, Poſterity ſhall ingrave him in the Albe of the Moſt Excellent Prelates, the moſt indulgent Fathers of the Church, and the moſt injured Martyrs.</q> His blood was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome tears that fell from thoſe Eyes which expected a pleaſure at his Death, and it had been followed with a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mourning, had not the Publick Miſeries, and preſent fears of Ruine exacted all the Stock of Grief for other objects.</p>
            <p>About this time the Faction clove into two Sects, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent,</hi> which hitherto had been united under one name of <hi>Patriots,</hi> or <hi>Godly,</hi> had joyntly conſpired War and diſturbed the Peace, and by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arts had acted all their luſts under the name and Authority of Parliament. For they would either early in the morning before the Houſe was full, or late at night, when thoſe whoſe cares were moſt for the Publick were abſent, being aſſured of the Speaker, propoſe and Vote what ſerved for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. If any thing contrary to it was about
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35342:73"/>to be reſolved in a full Aſſembly, they by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Scruples would ſo diſturb the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, that the determination was deferr'd to a deſired Opportunity. But if theſe failed, then would they ſurpriſe the Houſe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Vote that ſhould weaken and hinder the Execution of the former. When the moſt conſcientious were too numerous for them, then would they make neceſſities to ſend the leſs pliant to their wills into the Country. Thus the Leſſer, but more induſtrious, Party did circumvent the Greater, that were not ſo wary nor diligent. While they thus joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrive the Publick Ruine, they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten themſelves into the moſt conſiderable and profitable Offices of the Kingdom. But the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> having the advantage in Number and Power, and the diſſenſion in their Opinions growing ſtill higher by the Animoſities of the inferiour and obſcurer parts of their Sects, there was neither Faith nor Love among them, but what Fear and Neceſſity did force them unto. The <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> who comprehended all the ſeveral herds of Hereticks, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Seekers, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenaries,</hi> &amp;c. though they were the Diſciples of the other yet excelled their Maſters in Art and Induſtry, had their private <hi>Junto</hi>'s and meetings apart to mould their Projects, and aſſign to each of their Confidents their ſeveral Scenes and Methods; and, by proper
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35342:74"/>Applications to mens ſeveral humours, had exceedingly encreaſed their ſtrength in the Multitude, only they wanted the Power of the Sword, and the moſt uſeful Offices to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their Empire.</p>
            <p>This they effected by thoſe very practices they had learned from the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> and by procuring the Ordinance of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> (as they called it) they turned out <hi>Eſſex</hi> (whom they had before ſecretly cauſed to be ſuſpected, and who had neither glory in his War, nor ſecurity or quiet in his Peace) from his Generalſhip, and with him alſo the other Leaders that were favourers of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, under pretence that it was not fit that any Members of Parliament ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to a continuance of the War, by enjoying the profitable and powerful Offices in the Army, to which they would now give a new <hi>Module.</hi> Having by this Artifice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed thoſe whoſe Power they feared, they brought in as many Candidates of their own Sect as they could to be Colonels, and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was appointed General. This Man both Parties did the more eaſily conſent in, becauſe he was known to be of ſufficient Perſonal Valour, and of no private Deſigns, obſtinate by a natural Melancholy, rather than pertinacious in any Intereſt, and rather free from Baſeneſs, than ambitious of Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35342:74"/>by all theſe Qualities they ſuppoſed he would be obedient to the Reſolves of his Maſters. But the <hi>Independents,</hi> that were better informed of his ductile Spirit, and how eaſily he might be impoſed upon by a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Religion, got the great Patron of all the wildeſt and moſt unreaſonable Sectaries, <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> at firſt to be admitted into his Counſels, and aftewards to be the Director of all his actions, under the title of Lieutenant General. For although he likewiſe by the Self-denying Ordinance was made incapable of any Office in the Army, being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Parliament; yet thoſe Troops of <hi>Fanaticks</hi> whom he had amaſſed, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly led under the Command of the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> (both which he had caſt off) were inſtructed to refuſe the Conduct of any one but him. He was therefore permitted by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the General deſired, for a time to continue in the Army; but he never left it till he had changed that, ruined the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and turned out the General, that thus was the Author of his unlawful Power. For this Man, having a long time been poor and neceſſitous, the Patrimony that was left him being profuſely ſpent, and nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the Inſtruments of his Crimes, a bloody and fierce nature, a greedy ſoul full of bold and unjuſt hopes, yet able to conceal
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35342:75"/>them with a profeſſion of Modeſty, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Religion and Friendſhip, yet highly pretending to both, till he had ſmote under the fifth rib thoſe credulous hearts that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he was fitted for the moſt impious enterpriſes, for vexed by a preſſing and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous poverty, he reſolved to indeavour the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtance from ſuch a Condition, though by the greateſt wickedneſs, therefore uſed the Power he had now gotten to overthrow the whole State, and eſtabliſh himſelf in an abſolute and unſupportable <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which <hi>is the common iſſue of aſſaulting a Juſt and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince with Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe Tragedies and Changes was the Winter ſpent at <hi>London,</hi> while the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Oxford</hi> waits for the Iſſue of the Treaty at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> which, as all other Conſultations for Peace, was vain and fruitleſs. For the Faction would always obſtruct thoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by their proper Methods. If the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their affairs were proſperous, then would they make their Demands like Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions on conquered Slaves, deteſting to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate that the acquiſitions of their Swords and Blood ſhould be confirmed by a worſted Enemy. In a more humble fortune they would deprecate their drooping Party, <hi>not then to think of a Reconciliation which their unproſperous Arms muſt neceſſarily render harder
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35342:75"/>than their hopes; and that it was not for the Honour of a Parliament to ſeem to yield to any thing by fear or compulſion.</hi> Beſides theſe devices, many fictitious Letters were compoſed, falſe Rumours divulged, and witneſſes ſuborned, to make men ſuſpect that many dangerous Plots and portentous Deſigns were diſguiſed in theſe Overtures of Accord. Therefore the Commiſſioners of Parliament were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to offer no Expedient for an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, nor hearken to ſuch as were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to them in the Name of the <hi>King.</hi> His Majeſty ſeeing and bewailing his Condition, that He muſt ſtill have to do with thoſe that were Enemies to Peace, prepares Himſelf for the War at the approaching Spring: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Winter was infamous with many loſſes, either through the neglects or perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſome Officers; yet before the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for taking the field was come, His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Diligence had repaired thoſe da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1645.] In <hi>April</hi> He ſends the <hi>Prince</hi> to perfect the Weſtern Aſſociation, and raiſe ſuch Forces as the neceſſities of the Crown, which was His Inheritance, did require: with Him is ſent, as Moderator of His Youth, and prime Counſellour, Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> now Lord <hi>High Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Faithfulneſs had endeared him to His Majeſty,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35342:76"/>who alſo judged his Abilities equal to the Charge; in which He continued with the ſame Faith, through all the Difficulties and Perſecutions of his Maſter, till it pleaſed God to bring the <hi>Prince</hi> back to the Throne of His Fathers, and him to the Chief Miniſtery of State. After their departure the <hi>King</hi> draws out His Army to relieve His Northem Counties and Garriſons. But being on His march, and having ſtormed and taken <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in His way, He was called back to ſecure <hi>Oxford,</hi> which the Parliament Army threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tned with a Siege. But <hi>Fairfax</hi> having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Letter of the Lord <hi>Goring</hi>'s (whom a Parliament Spy had cajoled to truſt him with the delivery of it) to His Majeſty, wherein he had deſired Him <hi>to forbear ingaging with the Enemy, till he could be joyned with Him;</hi> he leaves <hi>Oxford,</hi> and made directly towards the <hi>King</hi> that was now come back as far as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrey,</hi> with a purpoſe to fight Him before that addition of ſtrength, and at a place near <hi>Naſeby</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire</hi> both Armies met on Saturday, <hi>June</hi> 14. <hi>Cromwell</hi> having then alſo brought ſome freſh Horſe to <hi>Fairfax;</hi> whoſe abſence from the Army at that time the <hi>King</hi> was aſſured by ſome (who intended to betray Him) ſhould be effected. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the <hi>King</hi> would not decline the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and had the better at firſt, but His van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing Horſe following the chaſe of their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35342:76"/>Enemies too far (a fatal errour that had been twice before committed) left the Foot open to the other wing, who preſſing hotly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, put them to an open rout, and ſo became Maſters of His Canon, Camp, and Carriage, and among theſe, of His Majeſties Cabinet, in which they found many of His Letters, moſt of them written to the <hi>Queen:</hi> which, not contented with their Victory over His Forces, they Print, as a Trophee over His Fame, that by propoſing His ſecret Thoughts, deſigned only for the breaſt of His Wife, to the debauched multitude, and they looking on them through the Prejudices which the Slanders of the Faction had already formed in their minds, the Popular hatred might be increaſed. But the publication of them found a contrary effect, every one that was not barbarous abhorred that Inhumanity among Chriſtians, which Generous Heathens ſcorned to be guilty of, and the Letters did diſcover, that the <hi>King</hi> was not as He was hitherto characterized; but that He had all the Abilities and Affections, as well as all the Rights, that were fit for Majeſty: and (which is not uſual) He grew greater in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by this Defeat, though He never after recovered any conſiderable power.</p>
            <p>For the Fate of this Battel had an inauſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence upon all His remaining Forces,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35342:77"/>and every day His loſſes were repeated. But though Fortune had left the <hi>King,</hi> yet had not His Valour; therefore gathering up the ſcattered remains of His broken Army, He marches up and down to encourage thoſe whoſe Faith changed not with His Condition. At laſt attempting to relieve <hi>Cheſter,</hi> though He was beſet behind and before, and His Horſe wearied in ſuch tedious and reſtleſs Marches, yet at firſt He beat <hi>Poyntz</hi> off that followed; but being charged by Freſh Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from the Leaguer, and a greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, He was forced to retreat, and leave ſome of His gallant Followers dead upon the place. After this He draws towards the North-Eaſt, and commands the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> with the Horſe that were left to march for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there to joyn with <hi>Montroſs,</hi> who with an inconſiderable company of men had got Victories there ſo prodigious that they looked like Miracles. But this Lord was ſurpriſed before he could get out of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> for His Horſe having taken 700 of the Enemies Foot, were ſo wanton with their Succeſs, that they were eaſily maſtered by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Party, and he himſelf was compelled to fly into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Theſe ſeveral Overthrows brought another miſchief along with it; for the <hi>King</hi>'s Commanders and Officers broke their own <hi>Peace and Agreement,</hi> which <hi>is the only Comfort and Relief of the Oppreſſed, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35342:77"/>which makes them conſiderable, though they are deſpoiled of arms,</hi> by imputing (as it uſeth to be in unhappy counſels) the criminous part of their misfortunes to one another. But many gallant Perſons, whom Loyalty and Religion had drawn to His Service, endured the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hazards before they delivered the Holds He had committed to their truſt; and by that means employing the Enemies Arms, gave the <hi>King</hi> time, who was at laſt returned to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> to provide for His Safety.</p>
            <p>Hither every day ſad Meſſages of Ruines from every part of the Nation came, which though they ſeemed like the falling pieces of the diſſolved world, yet they found His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit erect and undaunted. For He was equal in all the Offices of His Life, tenacious of Truth and Equity, and not moveable from them by Fears, a Contemner of worldly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and deſirous of Empire for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe He ſaw theſe Kingdoms muſt be ruined, when He relinquiſhed the care of them. But that which moſt troubled Him were the Importunities of His own diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Party to ſeek for Conditions of Peace, which He ſaw was in vain to expect would be ſuch as were fit to accept; for His former experience aſſured Him, that theſe men would follow the Counſels of their Fortune, and be more Inſolent now than ever. And for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35342:78"/>He was reſolved not to ſacrifice His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Safety, nor his Honour to Life This He often told thoſe that thus preſſed Him, and did profeſs in His Letter to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> (who likewiſe moved Him to the ſame,) that <hi>He would yield to no more now than what He had offered at</hi> Uxbridge, though He confeſſed <hi>it were as great a Miracle His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould hearken to ſo much Reaſon, as that He ſhould he reſtored within a Month to the ſame Condition He was in immediately before the Battel at</hi> Naſeby.</p>
            <p>But yet to ſatisfie every One how tender He was of the Common Safety, He ſent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meſſages to the Parliament for a Treaty, and offers to come Himſelf to <hi>London,</hi> if He may have ſecurity for Himſelf and Attendants. All which were either not regarded, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with Reproaches. And becauſe the people began to murmur at ſo great an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs of the Faction to continue the Wounds of the Nation open and bleeding, (ſince there were many Forts yet held out for the <hi>King</hi> by Gallant Perſons, beſides the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> had an Army yet unbroken, and <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Montroſs</hi> had conſiderable Intereſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> all which might be perſwaded in a Treaty to part with thoſe Arms which could not be taken from them without much blood;) and it was the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35342:78"/>common belief that theſe men ſought for Victory, not Peace and Liberty, which was now tendred: therefore to raiſe ſuſpicions in the Vulgar, it is ſuggeſted that the Cavaliers who came to Compound would take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>King</hi>'s Preſence, if He were permitted to be there, and kindle a new flame and War in the City. And that it might be thought they had real grounds for theſe fears, the Diſarmed Compounders were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depart above twenty miles from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and to injealous the people more, all the tranſactions of the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were publiſhed, and amplified with the malicious Slanders and Comments of the implacable and conſcious Demagogues, that ſo the terrors of the Vulgar being augmented, they might be frighted into a longer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> finding theſe men irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Peace, and that they had declared againſt His Coming, though without a Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tryes the Leaders of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army; but they proved no leſs pertinacious, and were now approaching to beſiege <hi>Oxford.</hi> Providence not leaving any more Choice, but only ſhewing Him a way for a preſent Eſcape, He goes in a <hi>Diſguiſe (which when Neceſſity cloathes Royal Perſons with, ſeems like an Ominous Cloud before the Setting of the

            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1646.] The <hi>King</hi> being come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>May</hi> 4. made a great alteration in affairs; <hi>Newark</hi> was ſurrendred by the <hi>King</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham</hi> having gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly defended <hi>Oxford</hi> till the Beſiegers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered honourable Conditions, delivered up that alſo. But the greateſt Change of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were at <hi>London,</hi> where when it was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, among whom the <hi>King</hi> had ſought a Sanctuary, various and different Diſcourſes were raiſed. <q>Some wondred that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had ſought a Refuge there where the Storm began, and how He could appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to find Relief from thoſe that were not only the Authors of His Troubles, but now the great Advancers of His Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: And they conceived <hi>no Promiſes or Oaths can be a ſufficient Caution from thoſe People that have been often Perfidious.</hi> Others judged that in thoſe neceſſities wherein the <hi>King</hi> was concluded, it was as dangerous
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35342:79"/>not to truſt as to be deceived; no Counſel could be better, than to try whether a Confidence in them would make them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and whether they would then be honeſt, when they had the Critical Opportunity to teſtifie to the world, that they intended not what they did, but what they ſaid; <hi>That they fought not againſt Him, but for Him</hi> But a laſt ſort bewailed both the greatneſs of the <hi>King</hi>'s Dangers, that ſhould make Him ſeek for Safety in a tempeſtuous Sea and falſe bottom; as alſo the debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Engliſh <hi>Genius,</hi> which was now ſo corrupted, that their Prince was driven to ſeek an <hi>Aſylum</hi> from their injuries among a people that were infamous and polluted with the Blood of many Kings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While others diſcourſed thus of the <hi>King</hi>'s journey, the Parliament heated by the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> fiercely declared againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were removing the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and uſed ſeveral methods to make them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and drive them home. For they kept back their Pay, that they might exact Free-Quarter from the Country; then they did extenuate their Services, derogate from their famed Valour, upbraid them as Mercenaries, threaten to force them out by the Sword. All which while the Engliſh <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> though they wiſh'd well to their Brethren,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35342:80"/>yet leſt they ſhould ſeem to indulge the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies of a ſtrange Nation, did not dare to plead in their defence. But the <hi>Scots</hi> themſelves for a time did juſtifie their Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Preſervation of His Majeſty <hi>by the Laws of Nature, Nations, and Hoſpitality, which forbid the delivery and betraying of thoſe that have fled to any for Succour.</hi> The Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratick Faction urged that it <hi>was not lawful for the</hi> Scots, <hi>their Hirelings, and in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, to receive the</hi> King <hi>into their Camp without the leave of their Maſters, and keep Him without their Conſent.</hi> Theſe Debates were uſed to raiſe the <hi>King</hi>'s price. Which when the <hi>Scots</hi> were almoſt aſſured of, to make their ware more valuable, they ſolicite the <hi>King,</hi> in hopes of their Defence, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Montroſs</hi> to depart from his noble Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he had almoſt recovered the Overthrow <hi>Roxbrough</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaire</hi> had betrayed him unto, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come formidable again; as alſo the Loyal Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> to deſiſt from his gallant Oppoſitions both of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces.

To this unpleaſingneſs of the Place they added other diſcomforts, by making the reſtraint ſo ſtrict that they ſuffered none to come near Him, that by owning His Cauſe were aſſured of their Welcome; yea, even His Chaplain (which moſt troubled Him) were debarred from their Miniſtery. But God ſupplyed this Want by more plentiful Aſſiſtances of His Holy Spirit, and made Him, like the Ancient Patriarchs, both a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> (at leaſt for Himſelf:) and here He ſacrificed Praiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While the <hi>King</hi>'s Soul was thus winged above the walls of His Priſon and the Fortune of His Enemies, they that had put an end to the War, yet could not find the way to Peace; for their Souls were unequal to the Victory, and could not temper their Succeſs, the two Sects falling to diſſenſion, and turning all their Arts and Arms one againſt another. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had the richer and more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did followers, but the <hi>Independents</hi> the moſt fierce, ſubtle, and moſt ſtrongly principled to Confuſion; the firſt was Powerful in the Parliament, but the latter in the Army. After they had a long time practiſed on one another the very ſame Methods they had acted againſt the <hi>King,</hi> and ſuch as favoured Him in the Parliament (of which there were always ſome Number among them) the <hi>Independents</hi> ſtill gained upon their Oppoſites, making the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> odious, by Libels compoſed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Government Ridiculous and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, by putting them upon all the moſt envious Employments, as Reforming the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, and Sequeſtring Miniſters that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Not contented thus to deal with their elder Brethren, by ſpoiling them of their Honour, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Thus the Counſels of both Parties being directed to overthrow their contrary, each thought the Perſon and Preſence of the <hi>King</hi> would be no vain advantage to their Deſigns, for they would Honeſt their actions with a care of Him: therefore the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had it in Conſultation, to Order Col. <hi>Greves,</hi> who had the Command of the Guard about the

               <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Holmeby,</hi> to remove His Majeſty to <hi>London;</hi> the Intelligence of which coming to the Army by the treachery of a certain Lord, they immediately ſend a Body of Horſe to prevent them, and to force Him into their own Quarters. Thus was that Religious Prince made once more the mock of Fortune, and the ſport of the Factions, and was drawn from His peaceful Contemplations, and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Heaven, to behold and converſe with men ſet on Fire of Hell. Theſe, to tempt Him to a Confidence in their integrity, (that they might the more eaſily to His diſgrace ruine Him, and murder Him by His own Conceſſions, if He would be deluded by them) highly <hi>pretend to a Compaſſionate Senſe of His Sufferings, and complain of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Barbarous Impriſoning Him in His own Palaces, wondering they had no more Reverence for Majeſty;</hi> and to beget a belief of this, they <hi>profeſs</hi> (which they would have to be conceived with them was more ſacred than any Oaths) <hi>that they will never part with their Arms till they have made His way to His Throne, and rendred the Condition of His Party more tolerable.</hi> Beſides theſe Promiſes and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they permit Him the Miniſtry of His Chaplains in the Worſhip of God, (which, it is ſaid, He took with ſo great a Joy, that He almoſt believed Himſelf free and ſafe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His moſt heavy burthen while He was the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35342:84"/>Parliaments Captive) the Commerce of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with the <hi>Queen,</hi> the Viſits of His own Party, and the Service of His Courtiers; ſome of whom they alſo admitted to their Council of War, mould Propoſitions which they will urge in His behalf, and alter them to the <hi>King</hi>'s Guſt and at His Advice. In their publick Remonſtrances againſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, Ambition, Injuſtice, Cruelty and Selfmindedneſs of the Parliament, they do ſometimes obliquely, ſometimes plainly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that <hi>the King, Queen, and the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily muſt be reſtored to all their Rights, or elſe no hope of a ſolid Peace;</hi> but then they would intermix ſuch Conditions as argued they ſought Reſerves for a perfidious eſcape. For <hi>Cromwell</hi> did among his Confidents boaſt of his fine Arts, and that by theſe Indulgences was intended nothing but His Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>By all theſe Impoſtures they prevailed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the Hopes or Fears of the <hi>King;</hi> nor did He commit any thing unworthy His former Fortune, and the Greatneſs of His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Wiſdom, or which any of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Factions could uſe to His reproach. But they found another kind of Succeſs upon the Parliament, for they ſacrificed to the Commands of their Stipendiaries eleven Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Commons, and ſeven of the Peers, cauſing them to forbear ſitting
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35342:84"/>among them, becauſe they had been accuſed by the Army in a very frivolous Charge. <q>All men wondering at the inequality of thoſe mens Spirits, who had ſo furiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Articles of their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign againſt five or ſix of their Body, and yet did now ſo tamely yield to the ſlight Cavils and diſlike of their Mercenaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thrice that Number. They therefore concluded, that neither <hi>Religion, Juſtice, or the Love of Liberty, which are always uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> but <hi>unworthy Intereſts and corrupt Souls, which vary with fears and hopes,</hi> had been the Principles and firſt Movers of their attempts.</q> Beſides this, they were ſo prone to Slavery, that they had gone on to Vote all the luſts of the Army, had not a Tumult (their Arts being now turned upon their own heads,) from <hi>London</hi> ſtopp'd them in their violent ſpeed, and kept the Speaker in his Chair till they had voted more generouſly, <hi>that it was neither for their Honour nor Intereſt to ſatisfie the demands of the Souldiers;</hi> and that <hi>the King ſhould come to</hi> London <hi>to treat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe contrary deſires of the divided Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which had joyntly oppreſſed their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, ſhewed, that <hi>Ill men will more eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together in War, than conſent in Peace;</hi> and that <hi>Combinations in Crimes will conclude in Jealouſies, each Party thinking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:35342:85"/>of the other too great; and that Power is never thought faithfull which is accounted exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</hi> Therefore both prepare for War. With the 140 Members that ſate in Parliament were joyned the City, and the caſhiered Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Officers that had ſerved in their pay. With the Army were the Speakers of both Houſes; who had fled to them with about fifty of their Members that projected the Change of Government, being either for an Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy or Democracie, yet left ſome of the ſame judgment behind, to betray and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Counſels at <hi>London.</hi> To theſe did adhere the Neighbouring Counties, who were cajoled by the ſplendid Promiſes of the Army, of <hi>Reſtoring the</hi> King. (which they much boaſted) <hi>Diſſolving the Parliament, and Eſtabliſhing Peace and Government:</hi> and they more wilingly credited theſe, becauſe they had conceived an hatred of the Parliament and City both for beginning the War, and now obſtructing Peace. The Army inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their attempts <hi>for King and People:</hi> Their Adverſaries, <hi>for bringing the King to His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> The Commanders were greedy of that War which promiſed an eaſie Victory, and made the poor Souldiers hope for the Plunder of the City.</p>
            <p>For the advantage was clear on the Army's ſide, which conſiſted of veterane Souldiers,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35342:85"/>united among themſelves by a long Converſe, and known Commanders: but the force of the other was made up of a tumultuary Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, gathered under new Leaders, and ſo had no mutual confidence; their meetings were full of doubts and fears, none could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in private, nor in publick Conſult, becauſe they dared not truſt one another; and it was obſerved that thoſe who were moſt treacherous talk'd moſt boldly againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Therefore in the very beginnings the Parliament and City deſert their Enterpriſe, Treat with, and open their Gates to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who march in Triumph through <hi>London,</hi> bringing the Speakers and their Fellow-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers to their Chairs, ſeize upon the <hi>Tower,</hi> diſmantle the Fortifications, pull down all the Chains and Poſts of the City, ſend the Lord Mayor and the Chief Citizens to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and reduce all the Power of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Obedience to the Commanders. For <hi>Fairfax</hi> is made General of all the Forces both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Rainsbrough,</hi> a Leveller, and a violent Head of the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticks, High Admiral. The impeached <hi>Presbyterians</hi> fled beyond Sea, others of that Sect drooping complyed with the Fortune of the Conquerours; and that which greived good Men moſt, was, <hi>a Publick Thanksgiving</hi> (which <hi>is not to be obſerved but for the happy endeavours of a Nation in their vertuous and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35342:86"/>glorious undertakings for Liberty and Safety,</hi> but now was prophaned for our Slavery and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery) to God was appointed for the Army, and they were entertained now at a Feaſt, whom before the City would have forced from their Walls.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were in Motion, the <hi>King</hi> conſults Heaven for Direction, and his Party modeſtly abſtain from either ſide, thought both to be abhorred, and knew that Party would be the worſt which ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The Army having now the greateſt ſtrengths of the Nation, the Parliament and City at their obedience, make no mention of their former promiſes to the <hi>King;</hi> only the Adjutators were fierce for breaking that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and calling another, as they call'd it, <hi>more equal Repreſentative.</hi> But both their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue and the Council of War, being now delivered from fear of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to contrive the deſtruction both of the <hi>King</hi> and Monarchy. As for the <hi>King,</hi> whom they had now brought to <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, ſome that had before contrived His Death, and to murder Him while He was in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Camp, (ſo at once to ſatifie their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and Load their Enemies with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of the Murder,) yet could not then perform it, were now fierce for a ſpeedy and ſecret Aſſaſſinantion by Piſtol or Poiſon.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35342:86"/>Others would have Him tryed and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their Council of War. But the Chiefs thought fit to proceed more artificially in their Crime, and when they ſhould get more Authority, deſtroy Him by a Parliamentary way of Juſtice. To bring this about, they muſt proceed to make Him more odious, that the People might be patient while they kill Him, and undo them. To proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to their Impiety, <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures ſtickle fiercely in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and cauſe the Parliament to ſend, not Conditions of Peace to be treated on, but Propoſitions like Commands that admitted no diſpute: which if the <hi>King</hi> had yielded unto, He had deſpoiled Himſelf of Majeſty, and been thought guilty of ſo much want of Spirit as would conclude an unfitneſs for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; beſides, ſuch a voluntary Diminution would have been equally unſafe, as unglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: And if He did not, then He was to be eſteemed the only Obſtacle of the Univerſal Peace. And leſt the <hi>King</hi> ſhould put them to more tedious Arts by ſigning them, they themſelves to divert Him privately procure more ſoft Articles, and profeſſed to be ſorry the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Sowreneſs and Rigour did yet leaven the Houſe, which made theſe Propoſitions ſo unpleaſant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> could not but perceive the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35342:87"/>of the Army, yet being reſolved that no Dangers whatſoever ſhould make Him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thoſe unreaſonable Demands of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which granted would have been the heavieſt oppreſſion on His Subjects, and the greateſt injury to His Poſterity He could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be guilty of; For <hi>to good Princes the Safety of their People, and their own Memory, which is built upon the Happineſs of Poſterity through their Counſels, are more pretious than Life and Power;</hi> and although Providence, and the Malice of His Enemies had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed His way to Glory by Victories and Succeſs, yet He would trace it in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envied and unqueſtionable paths of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice: Therefore to make His denial of them advantageous to Himſelf, by a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confidence in the Army's profers, thereby to oblige, if it were poſſible, thoſe that had no ſenſe either of Faith or Honour, or at leaſt, to injealous thoſe two Rivals for His Power, and commit them, the <hi>King</hi> abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Parliaments Propoſitions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the <hi>Demands of the Army as more equal, and fit for a Perſonal Treaty, and that the Army alſo ſhould nominate Commiſſioners. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and His Complices ſeemed to be joyful for this Anſwer of His Majeſty, which had preferred them before their Competitors to the Honour of Juſtice and Moderation in the Eyes of the People; but yet ſecretly did they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35342:87"/>exaſperate the minds of the more ſhort-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commons againſt the <hi>King</hi> for this Affront. And to the <hi>King</hi> they profeſs a ſhame and trouble upon their Spirits (for ſo they loved to ſpeak) that they could not now perform their Promiſes: ſometimes they excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a Reverence to the Parliament, at other times by the fierceneſs of the Adjuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and when by theſe excuſes they had coloured their delays to ſome length, they began to interpret their ſayings otherwiſe than the <hi>King</hi> apprehended them, to forget what they had aſſured Him of, and at laſt openly to refuſe any performance. To all theſe Perfidies they add other Frauds, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a fear in Him of the Adjutators and the Levellers, who they informed Him meditated His Murder, profeſſed they could not for the preſent moderate their bloody and impetuous Conſultations, but when they ſhould recover the loſt Diſcipline of their Army, then they might eaſily and ſpeedily ſatisfie their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Him. To give credit to their words, the Fury of the Adjutators was blown to a more conſpicuous Flame, their Papers were publiſhed for a change of Government, call'd <hi>The Caſe of the Army,</hi> and, <hi>The Agreement of the People;</hi> the animations of <hi>Peters,</hi> and another of the ſame Diabolical ſpirit, ſaying, <hi>His Majeſty was but a dead Dog,</hi> were divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and all were communicated to ſome At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35342:88"/>about the <hi>King,</hi> with an Advice from the Chiefs of the Army to eſcape for His Life: for they were unwilling He ſhould be killed while they helpleſly look'd on.</p>
            <p>The fury and threatnings of men of ſuch deſtructive and bloody Principles, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>all things lawful that they could do,</hi> that <hi>Providence adminiſtring Opportunity did invite and licenſe their impieties,</hi> and <hi>who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted all their luſts, that had no colour from Juſtice, to the Perſwaſions of the Holy Spirit,</hi> were not to be deſpiſed; nor was the <hi>King</hi> to abandon His Life, if He could without ſin preſerve it to a longer waiting upon God.

For it was diſcourſed in the Army above a fortnight before, that the <hi>King</hi> e're long
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35342:88"/>would be in the <hi>Iſle of Wight:</hi> and the very night He departed from <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, the Centinals were withdrawn from their uſual Poſts, on purpoſe to facilitate His flight. The all-wiſe God not permitting Him to fly from thoſe greater Trials, and more Glorious Acts of Patience He had deſigned for Him. Being here in this falſe Harbour, He minds that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs which lay moſt on His Heart, the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Nation; He ſends Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Parliament more benign and eaſie than they could deſire or hope, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with His Reaſons why He could not aſſent to their Demands; and earneſtly ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites them to pity the Languiſhing Kingdom, and come to a Perſonal Treaty with Him, on His Conceſſions and the Army's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>But the Conſpirators, to cut off all hopes of a Treaty, take this Occaſion to ſend four Preliminary Articles, which if He would paſs as Acts, they would treat of the reſt. Theſe were ſo unjuſt, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in the Name of their Kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt them in publick Writings, and following the Meſſengers of Parliament to the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> do in the preſence of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty proteſt againſt them as contrary to the Religion, the Crown, and Accords of both Kingdoms. The <hi>King,</hi> according to His

This Anſwer He deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſealed to their Meſſengers, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they might hear it read, and that they might be dealt with as Commiſſioners, not as bare Carriers (a greater truſt than which their Maſters had not commited unto them) and promiſe upon their Honour that it ſhould not be any prejudice to Him. But His Majeſty had no ſooner read it, than they finding it not to the Guſt of thoſe that ſent them, notwithſtanding the Faith they had given, cauſe their Juſt Soveraign to be kept cloſe Priſoner, force away His Chaplains, Dr. <hi>Shelden,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> both which He highly valued for their Integrity, Wiſdom, Piety and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and His other Servants, even thoſe whom the Parliament had placed formerly about Him, and in whom His Goodneſs had wrought both an Affection and Admiration of Him, and permit none about Him but ſuch as they hoped would be a Watch upon Him, and whoſe barbarous Souls might trample on His Fortune.

            <p>The like reception His Letter found with the Parliament. For <hi>Cromwell</hi> and His Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were reſolved to go on with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and having ſo long uſed the <hi>Adjutators,</hi> as ſerved to frighten the <hi>King</hi> into the Toils they had ſet, they ſoon quiet them, (which was not difficult, being a Company of hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed fellows, that could only talk, not form a Counſel or a Party, to endure a Storm,) by executing ſome of their moſt pertinacious Leaders; and being free of that care, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their practices wholly to the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His Majeſty. To this purpoſe they mould the Four Votes for <hi>No Addreſſes to the King;</hi> but before they bring them into Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, they ſend into their ſeveral Counties about forty or fifty of the principal Members, who they thought would oppoſe them, to raiſe Money for the Souldiers. Nevertheleſs the firſt of thoſe Votes was conteſted againſt ſo ſtrongly, that the Debates laſted from ten of the Clock in the Morning till ſeven in the Evening; and though they thus weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more Honeſt Party, yet could it not paſs till the Conſpirators had engaged that no worſe thing ſhould be done to the <hi>King.</hi> The remaining Votes were diſpatched in half an hours time, when thoſe of the more ſober

Which infamous Libel they cauſe to be ſent to all the Pariſhes of the Kingdom, to be divulged, ſuppoſing that none did dare to refute their black and moſt malicious Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or that none could publickly do it, becauſe they ſet ſtrict Watches upon all the Printing-Preſſes. They likewiſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Curates to read it in their ſeveral Churches, and commend it to the People. And that theſe might the more readily obſerve their Orders, they at the ſame time ſtrictly enjoyn the payment of Tithes, and Vote that the Dean and Chapiter's Lands (which they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:35342:91"/>had deſigned for profane Uſes, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they ſhould be for the Emolument of Church-men) ſhould be ſet apart for Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations for their Preachers, pretending a fervent zeal for the propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when they did moſt diſhonour it.

               </gap> foul-mouthed Conſpirators, did dare or hope with Succeſs to reply unto. The Curates coldly, if at all, obſerved their Orders, and there came ſo few Petitions, and thoſe ſigned by ſuch contemptible and lewd Perſons, as they rather loaded the Faction with more hatred, than gave them any credit. While generally in every place none of the People
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:35342:91"/>could contain their fury againſt theſe Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but publickly curſed them and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Adherents.</p>
            <p>For their Miſeries made them ſenſible of the want of that <hi>Prince</hi> whoſe gentle and juſt Rule had brought them to ſuch an inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Proſperity, that they had forgot the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of their Happineſs. But now they found Government when it was out of His hand, like <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod caſt on the ground, transformed to a Serpent; and that thoſe who pretended to free them from Tyranny had deluded them into the moſt inſufferable Slavery: wherein they were either totally deſpoiled of all things that render our Being comfortable, or they were not ſecure in the uſe of them. Religion, the Ornament of the preſent, and the Pledge of a future Life, was ſo diſhonoured by Schiſms and Hereſies (fomented to weaken the People by Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to a tameneſs under their Oppreſſors) by Faſts for the moſt impious Deſigns, and Thankſgivings for proſperous Crimes; that ſome men concluded it to be nothing elſe but the Invention of Tyrants, and the Diſguiſe of Villains, and therefore did forſake it, and turn Atheiſts. Others that did ſtill find the Inward Conſolations of it, yet feared openly to profeſs it, leſt they ſhould be taken for thoſe that pretended a Love to God, that they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35342:92"/>might more ſecurely deſtroy men. Liberty alſo was now but an empty name: for all the Common Priſons were too narrow to receive even thoſe that did not dare to break the Laws; ſo that the Houſes of Noble-men were converted to Gaols, for thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in honeſt enterpriſes; where they were to languiſh with want and ſickneſs and not be called to know their Offence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their Accuſers, becauſe they had not guild enough for a publick Condemnation. Some were put a Ship-board in the midſt of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, there to contract Diſeaſes: Others were ſold Slaves to foreign Plantations. Many to eſcape ſuch naſty Confinements, or an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Torture, fled from their Native Soi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> either to the Neighbouring Countries, where they were the Evidences of the Infamy and Barbarouſneſs of our Nation; or ſeeking for Shelter in the Iſles and Deſarts of <hi>America,</hi> polluted thoſe Rocks and Seas with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood.</p>
            <p>Propriety was no longer hedged up by Law; but whom the Violence of the Souldier did not impoveriſh, the frauds of <hi>Committee</hi> men would, from whoſe Rapines none were ſecure that had not been as criminal as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and few ſafe that did not ſeek their favour, and bow down to their Greatneſs: Theſe men taking advantage of the common
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:35342:92"/>evils, to ſatisfie either their private revenge, or luſts: for their Proceedings were not regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the known Laws; but the ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of their Maſters in Parliament and Army, or their own Pleaſures, were the Rules of adminiſtring Juſtice. An honeſt Fame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was a Mark for Ruine: for if any by juſt Arts had got the Eſteem of the People and the Affections of His Neighbourhood, and did not comply with their Intereſt, firſt he was vexed with Slanders and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; and afterwards with Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; eſpecially if he were a Miniſter: and it was their common Principle, that <hi>an Honeſt Cavalier was the worſt Enemy,</hi> and <hi>a Cavalier Saint did the moſt hurt;</hi> ſo that both their Vices and Vertues were equally hated. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Converſe was dangerous; for they had Informers in every place, and Spies almoſt in every Family of Note: Servants were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted to accuſe their Maſters, and the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in Religion did injealous and arm the neareſt Relations one againſt another: Men out of a mutual diſtruſt would haſten from Company, to conſult in private their peculiar Safety, for they knew their Words were obſerved, and their Secrets ſought after. Few Families but had by the Civil War ſome loſs to bewail; ſome mourned over their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Members in different Camps, and had cauſe to fear which ſide ſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35342:93"/>they muſt be miſerable in ſome part.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more Miſeries were more highly embittered by the uncertainty of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: For the Parliament, that had the name of Government, were guilty of all theſe Reproaches of a Community, being Slaves to thoſe whoſe intereſt it was to keep us thus miſerable; and if at any time they were free from the yoke of the Army, the two Sects kept them ſo divided, each Party labouring by Votes and Counſels to circumvent the other, that they could not mind the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Benefit. Beſides the Power they exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed was too much to be well uſed, for they engroſſed the Legiſlative Authority, and the Exerciſe of Juriſdiction. So that they would make Laws according to their Intereſt, and execute them according to their Luſt; this day's Vote ſhould contradict the former day's Order, and to morow we muſt violate what to day we ſolemnly ſwore to obſerve: ſo that men knew not what to obey, nor where to reſt. Thus all hopes of Liberty and Peace were loſt in the Confinement of the <hi>King,</hi> who only was found able and willing to determine our Miſeries. For His Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were Uniform, and His Endeavours for a Settlement conſtant; beſides His Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had illuſtrated, if not calcined, His En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments. For now when He had no Friends,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35342:93"/>Counſellors, or Secretaries, His Diſcourſes with Commiſſioners upon their ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and His Declarations of His own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, the Nations Slavery, the Injuſtice of His and their Adverſaries, were ſo excellently and prudently managed, that they undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the greateſt part, and reconciled many of His bitter Enemies: therefore the whole Nation now panted for a Return to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of ſuch an ineſtimable Prince.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations cauſed ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for His Deliverance, ſome Private, and others more Publick. The firſt was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by thoſe Servants whom the Parliament had placed about Him; for theſe won by His Goodneſs, of which they were daily witneſſes, twice plotted His Eſcape, and ventured their Lives for His Liberty, but failed in both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: and the laſt being diſcovered before it could be put into action, One <hi>Rolfe,</hi> a bloody Villain, (that had alſo endeavoured to poiſon Him, for which though he was publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, yet was acquitted by that Judge whom the Conſpirators had employed to hear that cauſe) waited to kill Him as He ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from His Chamber.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Anno</hi> 1648.] The more publick was that of the whole Nation: for inraged with their own Oppreſſions and the Miſeries of their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:35342:94"/>
               <hi>Prince,</hi> men in moſt Counties, even of thoſe that had adhered to the Parliament, but now vexed that they had been ſo baſely deluded, draw up Petitions for a <hi>Perſonal Treaty with the</hi> King; <hi>that the Armies Arrears being paid they ſhould immediately be disbanded; that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſhould be ſent into</hi> Ireland, <hi>and</hi> England <hi>quite eaſed of the Contribution, which they could no longer bear.</hi> To theſe Petitions there were ſuch innumerable Subſcriptions, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army, and Parliament were mad to ſee their Threats of Sequeſtration, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment and Death, to make no Impreſſion; and the Promiſes they likewiſe made were ſlighted, becauſe diſcredited by their former Perjuries. The firſt Petitioners were the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> men, who came in ſuch Numbers as had not been ſeen before, as if they would force, not intreat for, what was neceſſary. After them thoſe of <hi>Surrey,</hi> whom, by the command of the Officers and Parliament-men, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers aſſault at the Parliament-Doors, kill ſome, wound more, and plunder all: and for this brave Exploit upon unarmed Petitioners, they have the Thanks of the Commons, and a Largeſs for their Valour; that ſo the People might be affrighted from offering Petitions, which before the very ſame men had declared to be <hi>the Birth-right of every Engliſh-man.</hi> 
               <q>While men ſee and admire the Returns of the Divine Juſtice, and the reciprocal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:35342:94"/>of the Popular heat, that the very ſame Parliament that firſt ſtirr'd up this way of tumultuary Petitions againſt the <hi>King,</hi> now complained that the Honour and Safety of Parliaments was indangered by Petitions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But all their Tyranny upon the complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation prevailed nothing but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to a higher Indignation and more frequent Petitions. And when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they dealt with men obſtinate to their own Intereſts, which were not to be gained but by the Publick ruine, they fly from Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Arms, and intitle their juſt War, <hi>For the Liberty of King and People.</hi> And in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, as in <hi>Kent, Eſſex, Suffolk, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Cornwall, York-ſhire, Wales,</hi> and at laſt in <hi>Surry,</hi> multitudes take Arms for this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Cauſe. The Navy alſo fall off, and ſetting <hi>Rainsbrough</hi> their levelling Admiral on Shore, ſeventeen Ships deliver themſelves up to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by an Order of their own Parliament ſend into <hi>England</hi> (to recover the Liberty and Majeſty of the <hi>King</hi>) an Army under <hi>Hamilton.</hi> But all was in vain, God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed other Triumphs for His Majeſty, and to tranſlate Him to another Kingdom. For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being but tumultuarily raiſed, having no train of Artillery or Ammunition conſiderable, were ſoon ſuppreſt by a veterane
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:35342:95"/>Army provided with all neceſſaries. The <hi>Scots,</hi> either through weakneſs or wickedneſs of their Commanders, who made ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly a march that their Van and Rear were forty miles aſunder, were eaſily worſted by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who ſurpriſed their main Body, and <hi>Hamilton</hi> was taken Priſoner. <hi>Cromwell</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the ſcattered Parties into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they were likewiſe aſſaulted by <hi>Argyle,</hi> a domeſtick Enemy, and forced to ſubmit thoſe Arms the Parliament had put into their hands to the Faction of that falſe Earl; who calls another Parliament, from which all were excluded that in the former Voted for the <hi>King</hi>'s Delivery, and all the Orders of that Convention made void. <hi>Cromwell</hi> had the Publick Thanks, and the private Faith of <hi>Argyle</hi> to endeavour, as opportunity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the extirpation of Monarchy out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Navy alſo deſerts the <hi>Prince,</hi> being corrupted by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who was appointed for this Service; and when he had ingloriouſly bought off their Faith to their lawful <hi>Prince,</hi> himſelf was ignominiouſly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiered by the Conſpirators. Theſe great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments and overthrws of juſt Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes men variouſly attributed to different Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <q>Some to the Perfidiouſneſs, others to the Weakneſs of thoſe that managed them;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:35342:95"/>as alſo to the Treachery of ſome <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who in hatred to the Army firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and then in Jealouſie of the <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> baſely deſerted them. For the <hi>Rabbies</hi> of the <hi>Kirk</hi> curſed <hi>Hamilton</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Enterpriſe. Another ſort thought them unhappy, becauſe the greateſt part of the Undertakers were ſuch that formerly had either fought againſt the <hi>King,</hi> or elſe had betrayed Him, and God would not now bleſs their unexpiated Arms. And ſome to the Fate of the Kingdom, which God had decreed to give over to numerous and impious Tyrants, becauſe of their unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and impatience under ſo Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But while theſe things were managed by the Army that were now at a diſtance, and <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Terrors were greater in <hi>Scotland</hi> than here, the leſs guilty Parliament-men ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidering how impatient the People (who in <hi>London</hi> and other places had gotten innumerable Subſcriptions to a Petition for a Perſonal Treaty) now were of thoſe Injuries that were done to their Sovereign, how hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful themſelves grew, becauſe they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and inſlaved their own Privileges, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Liberties of the Subject to an inſatiable and Phanatick Army, and how an evident Ruine attended even their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:35342:96"/>of Him whom it was unlawful to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, did at laſt (though too late) contrary to the clamours of their Factious and Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Members, Repeal thoſe Votes which they had formerly made, of <hi>No more Addreſſes</hi> to the <hi>King.</hi> This being paſſed in both Houſes, they afterwards with a ſtrong Conſent Vote a <hi>Treaty</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>Honour, Freedom and Safety.</hi> The Factious Party in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment found themſelves too few and weak to oppoſe this impetuous tendency of the Two Houſes and whole Kingdom to Peace. But yet they endeavoured to fruſtrate the labours of their more ſince Members, and to baffle the People's juſt deſires of it, by impoſing many unequal Conditions, and obſtructive reſtrictions.</p>
            <p>For they procured that the Treaty ſhould be in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and not at <hi>London;</hi> that it ſhould be by Commiſſioners, and not immediately with the two Houſes, as was Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned. The Propoſitions that were ſent to be Treated were the ſame which had before been offered to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and were then rejected by Him, and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Army it ſelf as too unjuſt. The Commiſſioners were ſo ſtreightned in Power, that it was not lawful for them to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any one of the Conditions of Peace, not to alter the Preface, or change the Order of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:35342:96"/>the Propoſitions, nor to debate a Subſequent till the Precedent were agreed on. They could conclude nothing; they were only to propoſe the Demands, urge Reaſons for the Royal Aſſent, receive the <hi>King</hi>'s Anſwer, and refer all in writing to the Parliament, whoſe ſlow Reſolves, and the delays of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were ſuppoſed would conſume that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row meaſure of time which was appointed to debate ſo many and ſo different things, for they were limited to forty days. The Commiſſioners they ſent, were Five of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Houſe</hi> and Twelve of the <hi>Commoners,</hi> and with them ſome of their <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> who were to preſs importunately for their Church Government, to elude the <hi>King</hi>'s Arguments for Epiſcopacy, and only to impoſe, not to diſpute, their own.</p>
            <p>With all theſe, upon ſo many ſeveral and different Propoſitions, ſome relating to the Law of the Land, others to Reaſon of State, and ſome to the practice of the Apoſtolical Primitive Churches, the <hi>King</hi> was to deal without publick aſſiſtance. For though He was permitted the Miniſtery of ſome Officers of State, Counſellours and Divines, yet were they but of private advice, and to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Curtain; He only Himſelf was to ſpeak in the Debate, and ſingly to manage matters of Policy with their moſt exerciſed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:35342:97"/>Statiſts, and the points of Divinity with their beſt-ſtudied Divines. <q>The Vulgar, to whom the Arts of theſe men were not ſo obvious were much pleaſed with the Name of a Treaty, and now hoped to exchange their Servitude under ſo many importunate Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, for the moderate and eaſie Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one Lawful <hi>King.</hi> Others that had a clearer inſight, and obſerved with what difficulties it was burthened, hoped for no benefit from it. Becauſe that if His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould not Conſent, as they believed. He would not, then He would be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the popular impatience: And if He ſhould Conſent, He that now was thought to be moſt injuriouſly dealt with, would then be conceived not to deſerve the Pity even of His Friends; nor could He gain any other thing by His Conceſſions, than to be ruined with more Diſhonour. So that conſidering both the inviolable Integrity of His Majeſty, and the implacable Malice of His Enemies, they deſpaired of any happy Iſſue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But beyond the Faith of theſe men, and the Hopes of the other, the <hi>King</hi>'s incredible Prudence had found Temperaments for their moſt harſh Propoſitions. And by a preſent Judgment and commanding Eloquence di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſo urge His own, and refell their Arguments
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:35342:97"/>that He forced an Admiration of Himſelf and which was a Teſtimony of the Divine Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, drew many of the unwilling Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to His own Opinion (though their Commiſſion, and the danger of their Lives, neceſſitated them, contrary to the dictates of their own Conſciences, to prolong the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates;) with a wonderful Lenity proved their Demands unjuſt, yet granted what was not directly againſt His Honour and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Thus deveſting Himſelf of His own Rights, He demonſtrated that He had thoſe Affections which might juſtly ſtyle Him <hi>the Father of His Country.</hi> For He indeavoured by His own Loſſes to repair the damages of His People. Yet the <hi>King</hi> ſaw by the Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the moſt Powerful of thoſe He Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, that they intended nothing leſs than Peace, nor any thing more than His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; which that it might be adequate to their Malice, they would have it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the damnation of His Soul (as He Himſelf in bitterneſs complained to One of His Servants) preſſing Him to do thoſe things which they themſelves acknowledged ſinful, as the Alienation of Church-Lands. Although His Majeſty was thus ſenſible of their inſatiable thirſt for His Blood, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He had paſſed His Royal Word not to ſtir out of that Iſland, He did not hearken to the ſame Servant, who perſwaded Him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:35342:98"/>for His Safety by flight, which He aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him was not difficult, and in adminiſtring to which He offered to hazard his own blood. But the <hi>King</hi> always thought His Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Honour of Faithfulneſs, and would not give His Enemies that advantage over His Fame, which their unjuſt Arms and Frauds had gotten upon His Perſon, chuſing rather to endure whatſoever Providence had allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Him, than by any approach to Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſeek to protract thoſe days which He now began to be weary of: For <hi>that life is no longer deſirable to Juſt Princes, which their People either cannot or will not preſerve.</hi> And He thought <hi>it more Eligible to die by the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Others, than to live by His own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Treaty thus proceeded, the Army under the Command of the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> (this laſt was Bold, Subtle, Perfidious and Active in all Deſigns; ſo that his Soul being congenial with that of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> had been the cauſe of an Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, for he had Married one of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Daughters, and therefore was left to hover about the General as an evil <hi>Genius,</hi> that he might do nothing contrary to their Impious Deſign,) drew towards <hi>London,</hi> and quartered within half a days march from the City; that if their Intereſt did require, they might the more ſuddenly oppreſs thoſe who
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:35342:98"/>were leſs favourable to their Enterpriſes. The Officers did at firſt publickly profeſs a great Modeſty as that <hi>they would quietly ſubmit to the Orders of the Parliament; that they did prefer the Common Peace to their own private Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and ſhould be glad to be diſmiſſed from the toyls of War:</hi> yet in private practiſed an univerſal Confuſion, for mingling Counſels with their Factious Party in the Two Houſes, they ſet up again the Meetings of their Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, framed among themſelves Petitions againſt the Treaty, and to require that all Delinquents without difference (wherein they included the Perſon of the <hi>King</hi>) might be brought to Tryal; and by their Emiſſaris abroad drew ſome inconſiderable and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious perſons, (by repreſenting large ſpoils in the ſubverſion of Monarchy, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary advantages by the change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) to ſubſcribe to them.</p>
            <p>When they thought theſe practices had produced their deſired effect, and they had infected moſt of the Souldiers in the ſeveral Garriſons, and that more Parties of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were gathered to their Quarters about <hi>London; Ireton,</hi> under pretext of a Contraſt betwixt him and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> withdraws himſelf privately to <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, where being met by ſome of his Complices in the Parliament, they joyntly frame a Declaration in an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:35342:99"/>and affected Style. Wherein in the name of the Army he maliciouſly declaims againſt all Peace with the <hi>King,</hi> and His Reſtitution to the Government: afterwards he impiouſly demands that he may be dealt with as the Grand and Capital Delinquent: with theſe he mingles ſome things to terrifie the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome to pleaſe the Souldiers, and others to raiſe hopes of Novelty in the Rabble.</p>
            <p>This being prepared, and the Treaty now drawing towards an End (which thoſe of the Faction had prolonged and diſturbed, that the Army might have more time to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) and the Commanders having a perfect Intelligence how all things in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> and in the Parliament did ſtrongly tend to an Accommodation, they thought it now ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to begin their intended Crime. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſpeedily call a Council of War, at which met the Colonels, and other inferiour Officers, all men of Mercenary Souls, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Covetous, and ſo accuſtomed to Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, that they ſeemed to be compoſed by nature to frame and colour Impoſtures. They began their Meeting with Prayers and Faſting, pretending to inquire and ſeek the Will of God concerning the Wickedneſs they had predetermined to act. <hi>This is the conſtant practice of ſuch who would moſt ſecurely abuſe the Patience of the People, while they commit
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:35342:99"/>the moſt horrid Crimes. For not being able to honeſt their Iniquities by any colour of Reaſon, or any Command of the known Will of God, they pretend to a guidance by Revelation and Returns of Prayer.</hi> This Impoſture they had hitherto ſucceſsfully uſed; and the credulous Rabble of the common Souldiers were drawn to a perſwaſion, that God did counſel all the Deſigns of theſe armed Saints. Thus having prefaced their Villany, <hi>Ireton</hi> produces his Remonſtrance, which being read among them was received by the <hi>Souldiers</hi> (who, <hi>through a pleaſure in blood, and hopes of Spoil, are uſed to praiſe every thing of their Chiefs, whether good or bad, that tends to diſturbance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of War,</hi>) with as great an Applauſe as if it had been an Oracle from Heaven; and to make it the more terrible, they ſtyled it the <hi>Remonstrance of the Army,</hi> and order it to be preſented to the Parliament in the name of <hi>the Army and People of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When this Remonſtrance was publiſhed, the minds of men were variouſly affected. Some wondred that perſons of ſo abject a Condition ſhould dare to endeavour the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of an Ancient Government, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſo far above their fortune; and to deſign againſt the Perſon of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, who by the Splendour of his former Majeſty, and by a continued Deſcent from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:35342:100"/>ſo many Royal Progenitors, had derived a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that challenges the Reverence of the People. And they thought the act ſo full of a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Wickedneſs, that the Contrivers could not really intend the Execution, but only uſed it as a Mormo to frighten the <hi>King</hi> and Parliament to hearken to their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a leſſer guilt. Others conſidering their former Crimes and Injuries both to <hi>King</hi> and People, and their damnable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies of the Almighty God, did truly judge that their preceding Iniquities had now habituated and temper'd them for the extremeſt miſchiefs; and that having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus far, they would think their Safety conſiſted in an accumulation of their Sins. Only they admired that theſe men would diſcredit their ancient Arts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to God's Direction, (in which they could not ſo eaſily by every Vulgar judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be deprehended) by boaſting of the Concurrence of the People, which was too evident a Cheat, for not one in a thouſand through the whole Nation but did abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their practices. But others more Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative knew it was <hi>the accuſtomed Method of the Subverters of a lawfull Magiſtracy and Invaders of a Tyranny, firſt to ſeek the favour of the Rabble by high pretences of Liberty and Juſtice, and then to boaſt of it as though they had it, and were entruſted by the People to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:35342:100"/>recover what they preſented to their hopes and deſires;</hi> and that theſe men following the ſame practices would be the greateſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors of thoſe whom they pretended to vindicate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament though hitherto they had been very obſequious to the Army, yet the Members now meeting in greater Numbers than uſually, and preferring the utmoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards to a Compliance with this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, laid it aſide, and fell to debate the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Conceſſions</hi> which then lay before them. This free and ſtout Carriage of theirs was much reſented by the Souldiers, who ſtormed at the contempt of thoſe whoſe Grandeur de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon their Arms. And leſt they ſhould miſcarry in their Chief Deſign, and loſe the Sacrifice to their Ambition, they immediately ſent a Party of their Army into the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> to ſecure the <hi>King:</hi> theſe laying hold upon Him, with a moſt Inſolent Rudeneſs, not permitting the delay of a Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, forced Him from the <hi>Iſland</hi> into <hi>Hurſt Caſtle,</hi> an unwholeſome and ſordid place. The other part of their Army they cauſe to march towards <hi>London,</hi> with all the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigns of terrour, as if they went to ſack and plunder an Enemies Town. When they had entred, they were quartered in thoſe Houſes of the <hi>King</hi> and Nobility which were
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:35342:101"/>neareſt the Parliament-Houſe, hoping by the greatneſs and nearneſs of the danger, ſo to affright thoſe Members who were not ſo wicked as to comply with them, that they ſhould voluntarily withdraw, and hiding themſelves, leave the poſſeſſion to their own ſcanty Party. For then the Violence would ſeem leſs, and give more Authority to their unjuſt Decrees.</p>
            <p>But the honeſt Members were more in love with Juſtice, and therefore not terrified with the Menaces and Clamours of the Souldiers, but as inſpired with ſome unaccuſtomed Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage at this time, and thinking themſelves guarded by the Priviledges of Parliament, with a greater boldneſs than uſually they did upon deſigns, they appear in the Houſe. Where the <hi>Commoners</hi> re-aſſuming the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Conceſſions,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Debate till paſt Midnight; the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Party, and the Creatures of the Army ſtill raiſing new Doubts and Scruples, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying Cavils, and by tedious harangues waſting the time, that the more Juſt Party, which conſiſted moſt of Gentlemen of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, not accuſtomed to ſuch Watchings and Faſtings, might be wearied out, and leave them to their own Reſolves: and alſo that they might give time to the whole Army to march into the <hi>City</hi> that Night. Among the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:35342:101"/>reſt, Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> (who was born to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the world, and to be a firebrand of Communities, yet ſtill carrying his deſigns of Confuſion under a feigned meekneſs and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel) This Man in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> had perſwaded the <hi>King</hi> not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal in His <hi>Conceſſions;</hi> that He had already yielded more than was fit for them to ask, or Him to grant, and undertook to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the whole world: yet now did moſt fiercely and perfidiouſly inveigh againſt the <hi>Conceſſions,</hi> as deſigned by the <hi>King</hi> under the ſpecies of Peace to ruine the Parliament and Common-wealth. Yet at laſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe Terrours without, and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles within, the Houſe came to this Reſolve, that <hi>The Kings Conceſſions were a ſufficient ground for Peace.</hi> Which was carried by Two Hundred Voices, and there were ſcarce Sixty Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>The next day the ſame Reſolve was paſſed by the <hi>Lords</hi> in the very ſame terms, not one diſſenting. Who immediately adjourned for a week, to wait whether this fury of the Army would ſpend it ſelf after ſo generous an oppoſition. And the Houſe of Commons ſent ſome of their own Members to acquaint the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and his Officers of this their Vote. This free and publick deteſtation of the Crime, that was deſigned, did extremely
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:35342:102"/>enrage the Projectors of it, and the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratick Party in the Houſe mingled Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with their Advices. For One of the Chiefs of the Faction could not forbear to aſſure them, that <hi>If they continued in this their Reſolve, they ſhould never after have Liberty of meeting there again.</hi> Which accordingly was executed: for the next day they were to meet there, the Colonels had placed a guard of two Regiments of Foot and one of Horſe upon the Houſe of Commons, who ſtrictly keeping all the Avenues thereto, that none might enter without their Licence, laid hold upon Forty Members that were Perſons of the moſt known Integrity and higheſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; they denied admiſſion to One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty more, and ſuffered none to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of whoſe ſervile compliance they were not well aſſured. Some that had eſcaped their obſervation, and got into the Houſe, by tickets, as from Friends or Servants, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite forth; whom being once without doors they violently force away, while they in vain pleaded the <hi>Privileges of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The impriſoned Members they vex and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with great Indignities, expoſing them to the mockeries and inſolencies of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers: although there were among them many that had before Commanded Armies, Brigades and Regiments in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament's
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:35342:102"/>cauſe againſt the <hi>King;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had been moſt importunate aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their firſt injuſtice to their Prince. <q>Thoſe that beheld theſe viciſſitudes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and acknowledged the juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that had thus viſibly and properly puniſhed the Injuſtice of theſe men againſt their Lawful Sovereign by the miniſtry of their own more vile and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Souldiers, and did thus upbraid them with the falſeneſs of their Principles by which they acted againſt the <hi>King;</hi> the very ſame now ſerving to honeſt this violence that was committed on them: for both equally pretended to a Neceſſity of Reformation, and Self-preſervation. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were inquiſitive for the faith of theſe men, who taking up Arms for the Sacred Privileges of Parliament, had now left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Walls of that Houſe.</q> For the Number that would ſerve them was not equal to the Name of a Parliament, being ſcarce the eighth part of that Convention, and not much above Forty in all, and thoſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of that Aſſembly. For befides thoſe that were violently excluded, others that did abhor the Conditions of ſitting there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themſelves to their own homes. And many of thoſe who formerly deluded by their pretenſions to Religion, Juſtice and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, had hitherto been of the Faction, yet
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:35342:103"/>now awakened by thoſe clamorous Crime forſook their bloody Confederacy.</p>
            <p>Yet did not this contemptible Number, of which in moſt Votes there were Twenty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, bluſh to aſſume the Authority of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the weightieſt Affairs of the <hi>Engliſh Empire,</hi> to alter and change the Government, to expoſe His Majeſty to a violent Murther, and to overthrow the Ancient Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom. For being wholly devoted to the ſervice of the Army, they communicated counſels with them; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was reſolved at the <hi>Council</hi> of War, paſſed into a Law by the Votes of this Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Remnant of the Houſe of Commons, who now ſerved the Souldiers in hopes of part of the Spoil, and a precarious <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> which <hi>being acquired by ſo much Wickedneſs could not be laſting.</hi> In order therefore to the Army's deſign they revive thoſe Votes of <hi>No Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the</hi> King; (which had at firſt but ſurrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiouſly, and by baſe practices paſſed, and had been afterwards Repealed by a full Houſe.)

Theſe Conſiderations caſt the Determination on their ſide who, deſigning a Tyrannical <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy,</hi> whereby they themſelves might have a ſhare in the Government, would have the <hi>King</hi> proceeded againſt as <hi>King,</hi> that by ſo ſhedding His Blood they might extinguiſh Majeſty, and with Him murther Monarchy. For ſeveral of them did confeſs, that indeed He was guilty of no Crime more than that He was their <hi>King,</hi> and becauſe the Excellency of His Parts, and Eminent Vertues, together with the Rights of His Birth, would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Him to be a private Perſon.</p>
            <p>In their ſecond Debate about the Matter of Accuſation, all willingly embraced the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Harriſon</hi> (who was emulous of the Power of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and though now his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, yet afterwards became the Firebrand and Whirlwind of the following Times) <hi>to blacken Him</hi> as much as they could; yet found they not wherewith to pollute His Name. For their old Scandals which they had amaſſed in their Declaration for no more Addreſſes to the <hi>King,</hi> had been ſo publickly refuted, that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35342:108"/>they could afford no colour for His Murther. Therefore they formed their Accuſation from that War to which they had neceſſitated Him. And their Charge was, that <hi>He had levied War againſt the Parliament; that He had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Arms in ſeveral places, and did there proclaim War, and executed it by killing ſeveral of the Good People; for which they impeached Him as a Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer, and an implacable Common Enemy.</hi> 
               <q>This Charge, in the Judgment of Conſidering men, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued a greater guilt in thoſe that proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it than in Him againſt whom it was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for they ſeemed leſs ſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability and infirmities of humane Nature, than thoſe that had none but her light to make them generous, for ſuch never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached their conquered Enemies with their Victory; but theſe men would mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their own Prince, againſt whom they had nothing more to object than the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py iſſues of a <hi>War,</hi> which <hi>leaves the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the only Criminal, while the names of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Goodneſs are the ſpoils of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</hi> How falſe thoſe Imputations of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> were, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently underſtood by thoſe who conſidered the peaceful part of the <hi>King</hi>'s Reign; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was judged, that if in any thing He had declined from the ſafeſt Arts of Empire, it was in the neglect of a juſt Severity on
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:35342:108"/>Seditious perſons whom the Laws had condemned to die. And in the War it was known how often His Lenity had clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the wings of Victory. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that theſe men, as they had broken all Rights of Peace, ſo they would alſo thoſe of Conqueſt, and deſtroy that which their Arms pretended to ſave.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How little credit their Accuſation found, appeared by the endeavours of all Parties to preſerve the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon from Danger, and the Nation from the guilt of His Blood. For while they were thus engaged to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate their intended Miſchiefs, all Parties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt it. The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, almoſt all thoſe of <hi>London,</hi> and very many out of the ſeveral <hi>Counties,</hi> and ſome, though few, alſo of the <hi>Independents,</hi> did in their Sermons and Conferences, as alſo by Monitory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Petitions, Proteſtations and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, publickly divulged, adjure the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinates not to draw ſo great a guilt upon themſelves and the whole Nation by that Murther. <hi>For it was contrary to thoſe numerous and fearful Obligations of their many Oaths; to the Publick and Private Faith, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in their Proteſtations and many Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to the Laws of the Land, thoſe of Nature, and Nations, and the Commands of Scripture. That is was to the diſhonour of our Religion,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:35342:109"/>and againſt the publick good of the Kingdom.</hi> But all was fruitleſs, for they had loſt their Miniſterial Authority by ſerving the Faction ſo long, till they needed not their Aſſiſtance, and deſpiſed their admonitions: Beſides, the very ſame Principles they preached to kindle the War were now beat back into their faces, and made uſe of againſt them to adjuſt the Murther. The People alſo contemned them for their ſhort-ſightedneſs, in that they would be the heady and indiſcreet Inſtruments of ſuch men, and in ſuch practices as muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity at laſt ruine them and all Miniſters, as well as the <hi>King</hi> and Biſhops.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> alſo by their Commiſſioners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and proteſt againſt it. The <hi>States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by their Ambaſſadors (if they were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their truſt) did intercede, and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it as moſt deſtructive to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt. Some of the moſt eminent of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> as the <hi>Earl of Southampton,</hi> the <hi>Duke of Richmond,</hi> the <hi>Marqueſs of Hertford,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Lindſey,</hi> and others, neglect no ways, either by Prayers or Ranſom, to ſave the <hi>King.</hi> Yea, they offered themſelves, as being the prime Miniſters of the <hi>King's</hi> Commands, as <hi>Hoſtages</hi> for Him, and if the Conſpirators muſt needs be fed with blood, to ſuffer in His ſtead for whatſoever He had done amiſs. The <hi>Prince</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſaies all ways and means to deliver His
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:35342:109"/>Father from the danger. For beſides the <hi>States Ambaſſadours</hi> (whom He had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) both He and the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> did daily ſend as Agents the Kindred, Relations, and Allies of <hi>Cromwell, Ireton,</hi> and the other Conſpirators, with full power to propoſe any Conditions, make any Promiſes, and uſe all Threatnings to divert them, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from their intended Cruelty, or at leaſt to gain ſome time before the Execution. But all was in vain, for no Conditions of Peace could pleaſe them who were poſſeſſed with unlawful and immoderate deſires: their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition (that is more impetuous than all other affections) had ſwallowed the hopes of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; therefore they would remove the <hi>King</hi> to enthrone themſelves. Some thought that their deſpair of Pardon had hardened them to a greater Inhumanity, for if after all theſe attempts they continued the <hi>King</hi>'s Life, they muſt beg their own; which they knew Juſtice would not, and they reſolved Mercy ſhould not give; for this is reckoned among the benefits which we hate to receive, and <hi>Men are uſually aſhamed to confeſs they deſerved death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatſoever it was that truly made them thus cruel, they publickly pretended no other Motive than the <hi>Calls</hi> and <hi>Ducts</hi> of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and the <hi>Impulſes</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit.</hi>

               <hi>Poor Souls! for a piece of Money they would do as much for their Commanders.</hi> As He paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed along, ſome in defiance ſpit upon His Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and one or two (as it was reported by an Officer of theirs, who was one of their Court, and praiſed it as an evidence of His Souldiers Gallantry, while others were ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with their prodigious baſeneſs) polluted His Majeſtick Countenance with their unclean ſpittle: the <hi>Good King,</hi> reflecting on His great <hi>Exemplar</hi> and Maſter, wiped it off, ſaying, <hi>My Saviour ſuffer'd far more than this for me.</hi> Into his very face they blowed their ſtinking Tobacco, which they knew was very diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Him; and in the way where He was to go, juſt at His feet, they flung down pieces of their naſty pipes. And as they had deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves of all humanity, ſo were they impatient and furious if any one ſhewed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence or Pity to Him as He paſſed. (For <hi>no honeſt Spirit could be ſo forgetful of humane frailty, as not to be troubled at ſuch a ſight; to ſee a Great and Juſt King, the rightful Lord of three flouriſhing Kingdoms, now forced from His Throne, and led captive through the ſtreets.</hi>) Such as pull'd off their Hats, or bowed to Him, they beat with their Fiſts and Weapons, and knock'd down one dead but for crying out, <hi>God be merciful unto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they had brought Him to His Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:35342:113"/>even there they ſuffered Him not to reſt, but thruſting in and ſmoaking their filthy Tobacco, they permitted Him no privacy to <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Meditation.</hi> Thus through vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Tortures did the <hi>King</hi> paſs this day, and by His Patience wearied His Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors: nothing unworthy His former greatneſs of Fortune and Mind by all theſe Affronts was extorted from Him, though <hi>Indignities and Injuries are unuſual to Princes,</hi> and theſe were ſuch as might have forced paſſion from the beſt-tempered meekneſs, had it not been ſtrengthned with aſſiſtance from Heaven. In the Evening the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> were acquainted by a Member of the Army, of the <hi>King</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that ſeeing His death was nigh, it might be permitted Him to ſee His <hi>Children,</hi> and to receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and that Doctor <hi>Jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then Lord <hi>Biſhop of London,</hi> (now <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury</hi>) might be admitted to pray with Him in His private Chamber. The firſt they did not ſcruple at, the Children in their power being but two, the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Gloceſter,</hi> and they very young. The ſecond they did not readily grant. Some would have had <hi>Peters</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that employment for which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was ſent for: But he declined it with ſome Scoffs, as knowing that the <hi>King</hi> hated the Offices of ſuch an unhallowed Buffoon. So that at laſt they permitted the Biſhops ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:35342:113"/>to the <hi>King,</hi> to whom his eminent Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity had made him dear. For with ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a prudence and uprightneſs he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the envious Office of the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> that that accuſing age, eſpecially of <hi>Church-men,</hi> found not matter for any impeachment, nor ground for the leaſt reproach.</p>
            <p>The next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was removed to S. <hi>James</hi>'s, where the <hi>Biſhop of London</hi> read Divine Service, and preached before Him in private on theſe words, <hi>In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men by Jeſus Chriſt according to my Goſpel.</hi> While the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> at this time, and alſo at other times, were performing the <hi>Divine Service,</hi> the rude Souldiers often ruſhed in, and diſturbed their <hi>Offices</hi> with vulgar and baſe Scoffs, vain and frivolous Queſtions. The Commanders likewiſe, and other impertinent <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> did interrupt His Meditations, who came to tempt and try Him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Him, to ſome unneceſſary diſputations. But He maintained His own Cauſe with ſo irrefragable Arguments, that He put ſome to ſilence, the petulancy of others He neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with a modeſt contempt diſſembled their Scoffs and Reproaches. In the narrow ſpace of this one day, and under ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Affronts and Diſturbances, the <hi>King</hi> (whoſe whole Soul was totally compoſed to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:35342:114"/>Religion,) applyed Himſelf, as much as was poſſible, to the Reading Holy Scriptures, to Prayer, Confeſſion of Sins, Supplications for the forgiveneſs of His Enemies, the receiving the Euchariſt, holy Conferences, and all the Offices of Piety: ſo under the utmoſt Malice and Hatred of men, He laboured for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and to fit Himſelf for His laſt victory over Death.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>King</hi> thus ſpent this day, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> in the ſeveral Churches in <hi>London,</hi> and in thoſe parts of the Kingdom where His danger was known, were very earneſt in their Prayers to God for His Deliverance and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Aſſiſtance. <q>Some of them in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons declared the horrour of that ſin that was about to be committed, deteſted the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the Parricides, and denounced the heavy Judgments which ſuch a ſinful Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on polluted with their Prince's blood were to expect. The <hi>Congregations</hi> were diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Tears. Some bewailed the ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>King,</hi> as the effect of the Sins of the Nation. Others curſed their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Credulity of the Slanders of that Juſt Man, and the promiſes of Liberty by their Impoſtors. And another ſort wept, becauſe their Fears did prognoſticate thoſe Miſeries which the Iſſue of His blood would let in upon them. And every one found matter
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:35342:114"/>of grief, fear, and indignation in the loſs of ſo Excellent a Prince. All countenances were full of ſadneſs and aſtoniſhment, there was no Tumults nor any Quiet, every one liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and hearkning, either as impatient to know the greatneſs of their Miſery, or greedy to receive ſome hopes of Comfort in their Sovereign's Safety; otherwiſe there was a ſtilneſs like that which too ſtrong Paſſions effect, and might be thought a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity rather than a Calmneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, being <hi>Jan.</hi> 29. the <hi>King</hi> was permitted the ſight of His Children. His conference and words with them was taken in writing and communicated to the World by the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> His Daughter, a Lady of moſt eminent Endowments; who though born in the ſupremeſt Fortune, yet lived in continual Tears, the paſſages of her Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent in beholding the Ruines of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the Murther of her dear Father, whom ſhe not long ſurvived, but died in that Confinement to which they had cheated His Majeſty, in <hi>Carisbrook Caſtle</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While theſe things were done in publick, the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> meet in private in a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, to appoint every one their part in this Tragedy, determine what Geſtures they were
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:35342:115"/>to affect, what Words they were to uſe, as alſo for the manner, place and time of the <hi>Murther.</hi> In which Conſultations, both now and before the Sentence, each one according to the bloodineſs of his temperament, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilely to flatter <hi>Cromwell,</hi> by their Cruelty to Him that did obſtruct his Ambition, did propoſe ſeveral ways either of contempt or hatred in killing their ſentenced, yet anointed, <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Some would have His Head and Quarters faſtned upon Poles (as it is uſual with Traitors) that the marks of their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might out-laſt His Death. Others would have Him hanged, as they puniſhed Thieves and Murtherers. Others gave their Vote that He ſhould ſuffer in His Royal Habiliments with His Crown, and in His Robes, that it might be a Triumph of the Peoples power over <hi>Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt they think it ſufficient that He ſhould loſe His Head by the ſtroak of an Axe on a Scaffold near <hi>White Hall</hi> Gates before the <hi>Banqueting</hi> Houſe, that ſo from thence where He uſed to ſit on His Throne, and ſhew the Splendour of Majeſty, He might paſs to His Grave; there parting with the Enſigns of Royalty, and laying them down as Spoils, where He had before uſed them as the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Empire. Thus did they endeavour to make their Malice Ingenious, and provided
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:35342:115"/>Triumphs for their revenge. And becauſe they ſuſpected, or were informed, that as the <hi>King</hi> had not owned their Authority, ſo He would not ſubmit to their Execution, nor willingly ſtoop to the Block, they cauſed to be faſtned in it ſome Iron Staples and Rings, that by them with Cords they might draw Him down, if He would not comply. But His prudent Meekneſs prevented this Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; and He died diſowning their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, though He could not eſcape their Power.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe Preparations, they cauſe ſome Souldiers to offer to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> certain Articles and Conditions, to which if He would ſubſcribe, they promiſe Life, and the continuance of a precarious Empire: either out of a Terrour and Fear of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of their Impieties; for the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of contriving great Crimes is often turned into a ſollicitude when they come to be acted: or out of Deſign to ruine His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Honour, together with His mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life, if He ſhould conſent. But when one or two of them had been read to Him, He refuſed to hear any more, ſaying, <hi>I will ſuffer a thouſand deaths ere I will ſo proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute my Honour, or betray the Liberties of my People.</hi> Thus mindful of Juſtice, He would not deface the Splendour of His former

            <p>At laſt that Fatal Day, <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and that morning, a little before H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in them found an unexpected Comfort; for the Goſpel for that Day being the Hiſtory of the Paſſion of our Saviour, did by that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſtrengthen the <hi>King</hi> to follow <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to take up His Croſs; and His Majeſty was thankful for that Pattern. Being thus confirmed by the Blood (for He took the Sacrament that Morning) and ſufferings of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:35342:116"/>His LORD (whoſe Vicegerent He was) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with His own Innocency, againſt the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Death, He was brought from S. <hi>James</hi>'s through the Park to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> walking very faſt, and with as chearful a Countenance as if He were going to Hunting, (a Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion He was much pleaſed with,) often advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing His ſlow Guards to move faſter, adding, <hi>I now go before you to ſtrive for an Heavenly Crown, with leſs ſollicitude than I formerly have led My Souldiers for an Earthly Diadem.</hi> And being come to the end of the Park, He with much Alacrity went up the Stairs leading to the long Gallery in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſo into the <hi>Cabinet-Chamber,</hi> where He continued ſome time in Devotion, while they were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Theatre of His Murther</p>
            <p>While theſe things were acting, the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who had always forborn any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick appearance in the practices of this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had taken up (as is credibly reported) ſome Reſolutions, (either in abhorrency of the Crime, or by the Solicitations of others) with his own Regiment, though none elſe ſhould follow him, to hinder the Execution. This being ſuſpected or known, <hi>Cromwell, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Harriſon</hi> coming to him, after their uſual way of deceiving, endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, that the LORD <hi>had rejected the King,</hi> and with ſuch like Language as they
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:35342:117"/>knew had formerly prevailed upon him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing that they had that very morning ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he Warrant for the Aſſaſſination; they alſo deſired him <hi>with them to ſeek the LORD by Prayer, that they might know his mind in the thing.</hi> Which he aſſenting to, <hi>Harriſon</hi> was appointed for the Duty, and by compact to draw out his profane and blaſphemous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God in ſuch a length as might give time for the Execution, which they privately ſent to their Inſtruments to haſten; of which when they had notice that it was paſt, they roſe up, and perſwaded the General that this was a full return of Prayer, and God having ſo manifeſted his pleaſure, they were to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in it. There was likewiſe another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made by Col. <hi>Downes,</hi> who had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed them in their Court, to obſtruct them in their Execution; for it is ſaid, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make a Mutiny in the Army to hinder the Wickedneſs, but the haſt of the Aſſaſſinates prevented him.</p>
            <p>While theſe men acted their Wickedneſs by Prayers, to the laſting reproach of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, the <hi>King,</hi> after He had finiſhed His Supplications, was through the <hi>Banqueting</hi>-Houſe brought to the Scaffold, which was dreſs'd to terrour, for it was all hung with Black, where were attending two Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in Diſguiſes, and the Axe and the Block
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:35342:117"/>prepared. But it prevailed not to affright Him whoſe Soul was already panting after another Life. And therefore He entred this ignominious and gaſtly Theatre with the ſame mind as He uſed to carry to His Throne, ſhewing no fear of death, but a Solicitude for thoſe that ſhould live after Him. Looking about He ſaw divers Companies of Horſe and Foot ſo placed on each ſide of the Street and about the Scaffold, that the People could not come near Him, and thoſe that ſaw could not be Hearers; therefore omitting that Speech which it was probable He would have ſpoken to the People, He ſpoke to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and thoſe that were then about Him, that which is now printed among His Works.</p>
            <p>Having ended His Speech, He declared His Profeſſion of Religion; and while He was preparing for the Block, He expreſſed what were His Hopes (for all the Righteous have ſuch) in Death, ſaying, <hi>I have a good Cauſe and a Gracious God on my ſide; I go from a Corruptible to an Incorruptible Crown, where no diſturbance can be, no diſturbance in the world.</hi> After this compoſing Himſelf to an Addreſs to God, having His Eyes and Hands like forerunners lifted up to Heaven, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome ſhort and private Ejaculations, He kneeled down before the Block as at a Desk of Prayer, and meekly ſubmitted His <hi>Crowned

            <p>Thus the <hi>King</hi> finiſhed His Martyrdom but His Enemies not their Malice, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their Cruelty beyond His Life, and abuſed the Headleſs Trunk.

Some did it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Reliques of ſo Glorious a Prince, whom they ſo dearly loved. Others hoped that they would be as means of Cure for that diſeaſe which our Engliſh <hi>Kings</hi> (through the Indulgence of Heaven) by Their touch did uſually heal: and it was reported that theſe Reliques experienced failed not of the effect. And ſome out of a brutiſh malice would have them as ſpoils and trophees of their hatred to their Lawful Sovereign. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that he might feed his eyes with Cruelty, and ſatisfie his ſollicitous Ambition, which aſpired at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>

            <p>Afterwards they delivered the body to be unbowelled to an infamous <hi>Empirick</hi> of the Faction, together with the rude <hi>Chirurgions</hi> of the Army (not permitting the <hi>King</hi>'s own Phyſicians to this Office) who were all moſt implacable enemies to His Majeſty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them <hi>to ſearch</hi> (which was as much as to bid them ſo report) <hi>whether they could not find in it Symptomes of the French diſeaſe, or ſome evidences of Frigidity, and natural impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency:</hi> that ſo they might have ſome colour to ſlander Him who was eminent for <hi>Chaſtity;</hi> or to make His Seed infamous. But this wicked deſign was prevented by a <hi>Phyſician</hi> of great Integrity and Skill, who intruding himſelf among them at the Diſſection, by his Preſence and Authority kept the obſequious Wretches from gratifying their Opprobrious Maſters.

For <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> in his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Royſton</hi> who Printed it, asked him, <hi>How he could think ſo bad a man</hi> (for ſuch would that Monſter have this Excellent Prince thought to be) <hi>could write ſo good a Book.</hi> Therefore they laboured by all ways and means to ſuppreſs it, as the greateſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt them to Poſterity, and which would make them odious in all Generations. For <hi>the Blood of the Holy, Wiſe and Eloquent, leaves eternal stains of Infamy upon thoſe that ſpill'd it; becauſe no man reads their Works, but they curſe thoſe cruel hands which cut the veins and ſtopp'd the ſtreams of ſo much Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and we eſteem them harbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Monſters who did not Reverence the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe whoſe Writings we admire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But their fury became ridiculous, while they thought by their preſent power to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt His Memory, and take off the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:35342:120"/>of the following Ages; for the more they hindred the Publication, the more earneſtly it was ſought after: yet they endeavoured it another way, and therefore hired certain mercenary Souls to deſpoil the <hi>King</hi> of the Credit of being the Author of it. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially one baſe Scribe, naturally fitted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Satyres and invent Reproaches, who made himſelf notorious by ſome licentious and infamous Pamphlets, and ſo approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf as fit for their ſervice. This man they encouraged (by tranſlating him from a needy Pedagogue to the Office of a Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) to write that Scandalous Book <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (an Invective againſt the <hi>King</hi>'s Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) and to anſwer the learned <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his Defence of <hi>Charles the Firſt.</hi> But all was in vain, for thoſe that were able to judge of <hi>Styles</hi> found it muſt be the ſame Pen which wrought theſe Meditations, and drew thoſe Letters which the Faction had publiſhed for His. Others, that were not able to ſatisfie themſelves by ſuch a Cenſure, were aſſured of it by the Relations of Colonel <hi>Hammond</hi> that was His Keeper, who did atteſt to ſeveral Perſons that he ſaw them in the <hi>King</hi>'s hand, heard Him read them, and did ſee Him to correct them in his preſence. The Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> did alſo affirm to thoſe he converſed with, that he was employed by a Command from the <hi>King</hi> to get ſome of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:35342:121"/>them out of the hands of the Faction, for they were taken in His Cabinet at <hi>Naſeby.</hi> And <hi>Royſton</hi> that Printed them did teſtifie to thoſe that enquired of him, that the <hi>King</hi> had ſent to him the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> before His death; to provide a Preſs for ſome Papers He ſhould ſend to Him, which were theſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a deſign for a Picture before the Book; which at firſt was Three Crowns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented on a Wreath of Thorns, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>King</hi> recalled that, and ſent that other which is now before His Book. Thus theſe ſeveral Teſtimonies did ſecure the faith of the World againſt the Slanderers, and made their endeavours as contemptible as themſelves were hateful.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Parricides</hi> were ſeeking for freſh Occaſions to expreſs their Malice, the whole Kingdom was compoſed to Mourning and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; for never any <hi>King,</hi> not only of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but of whatſoever Throne, had His death lamented with greater Sorrows, nor left the World with a higher regret of the People. When the news of His Death was divulged, Women with Child for grief caſt forth the untimely Fruit of their Womb, like Her that fell in Travel when <hi>the Glory was departed from Iſrael.</hi> Others, both Men and Women, fell into Convulſions and ſwound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fits, and contracted ſo deep a Melancholy
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:35342:121"/>as attended them to the Grave. Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of themſelves, as though they could not, or would not, live when their beloved Prince was ſlaughtered, (it is reported) ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fell down dead. The Pulpits were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bedewed with unſuborned Tears; and ſome of thoſe to whom the living <hi>King</hi> was for Epiſcopacie's ſake leſs acceptable, yet now bewailed the loſs of Him when dead. Children (who uſually ſeem unconcerned in publick Calamities) were alſo affected with the news, and became ſo prodigal of their Tears, that for ſome time they refuſed comfort; even ſome of thoſe who ſat as Judges could not forbear to mingle ſome Tears with His Blood when it was ſpilt. Many compoſed Elegies and ſerious Poems to preſerve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of His Vertues, to expreſs their own Griefs, and to inſtruct the Mournings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and their Paſſions made them above their uſual Strain more elegant. Many who writ the Acts of His time did vindicate His Honour, and divulged the baſe Arts of His Enemies, even while their Power was dreadful.</p>
            <p>Men of all Sorts, Degrees and Sects (there being none among which He had not ſome Admirers) then freely and without Envy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted His ſeveral Vertues, which now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as great as Mortality refined by Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:35342:122"/>was capable of. For <hi>though Proſperity makes the Severeſt tryals of Vertues, yet Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity renders them moſt Orient.</hi> As the night beſt acquaints us with the Splendor of the Stars.</p>
            <p>That which firſt challenged their Wonder, was the Compoſure and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of His Soul to <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Majeſties Religion.</note> which He uſed not as an Artifice of Empire, but as the Ornament and Comfort of a private breaſt; for He never affected a Magnifick Piety nor a Pompous Vertue, but laboured to approve Himſelf in ſecret to that God who reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth openly. All His Offices in this were, like His Fortune, far above thoſe of other men; His Devotion in Prayer was ſo raiſed, that His Soul ſeemed to be wholly ſwallowed up in the Contemplation of that Majeſty He did adore, and as in an Ecſtaſie to have left His ſenſes without its Adſiſtency. An inſtance of this was given at the Death of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the news of whoſe Murther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whiſpered to the <hi>King</hi> while He was at Prayers, He took no notice of it (although it was ſo weighty an Occurrence to have His prime Miniſter cut off in the buſie Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a great Deſign) till He had finiſhed His Addreſſes to Heaven, and His Spirit was diſmiſſed from the Throne of Grace to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:35342:122"/>the Cares of that on Earth. This was ſo clear an Evidence of a moſt fixed Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thoſe who built their Hopes upon His Reproaches, ſlanderouſly imputed it to a ſecret Pleaſure in the fall of him whoſe Greatneſs was now terrible to the Family that raiſed it; which both His Majeſties care of the Duke's Children afterwards, as alſo the Conſideration of His Condition, did evince to be falſe, and that the <hi>King</hi> neither hated him, nor needed to fear him whom He could have ruined with a Frown, and have obliged the People by permitting their fury to paſs upon him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, His Majeſty's conſtant Diligence in thoſe Duties did demonſtrate, that nothing but a Principle of Holineſs, which is always uniform, both moved and aſſiſted Him in thoſe ſacred Performances, to which He was obſerved to go with an exceeding Alacrity as to a raviſhing pleaſure, from which no leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Pleaſures nor Buſineſs were ſtrong enough for a Diverſion. In the morning before He went to <hi>Hunting</hi> (His beloved Sport) the Chaplains were before Day call'd to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery: and when He was at <hi>Brainford</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Noiſe of Arms, and near the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of His Enemies, He cauſed the Divine that then waited to perform his accuſtomed Service, before He provided for Safety, or
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:35342:123"/>attempted at Victory; and would firſt gain upon the Love of Heaven, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repel the Malice of men. Thoſe that were appointed by the Parliament to attend Him in His Reſtraints wondred at His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Devotions in His Cloſet; and no Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Army was ſo likely to abuſe Him to a Credulity of their good Intentions, as the Permiſſion of the Miniſtery of His Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains in the Worſhip of God, a mercy He va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, to ſome of His Servants, above that of enjoying. Wife and Children.</p>
            <p>At Sermons He carried Himſelf with ſuch a Reverence and Attention (that His Enemies which hated, yet did even admire Him in it,) as if He were expecting new Inſtructions for Government from that God whoſe Deputy He was, or a new Charter for a larger Empire: and He was ſo careful not to neglect any of thoſe Exerciſes, that if on Tueſday mornings, on which Days there uſed to be Sermons at Court, He were at any diſtance from thence, He would ride hard to be preſent at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of them.</p>
            <p>When the State of His Soul required, He was as ready to perform thoſe more ſevere parts of Religion which ſeem moſt diſtaſtful to Fleſh and Blood. And he never refuſed to take to Himſelf the ſhame of thoſe acts
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:35342:123"/>wherein He had tranſgreſſed, that He might give Glory to His God. For after the Army had forced Him from <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and in their ſeveral removes had brought Him to <hi>Latmas,</hi> an houſe of the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> on <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. being Sunday, in the morning before Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon He led forth with Him into the Garden the Reverend Dr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> (who then attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Him, and whom He was pleaſed to uſe as His Confeſſor) and drawing out of His Pocket a Paper, commanded him to read it, tranſcribe it, and ſo to deliver it to Him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This Paper contained ſeveral Vows, which He had obliged His Soul unto for the Glory of His Maker, the advance of true Piety, and the emolument of the Church. And among them this was one, that <hi>He would do Publick Penance for the Injuſtice He had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be done to the Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>His conſent to thoſe Injuries that were done to the Church of</hi> England (though at that time He had yielded to no more than the taking away of the High Commiſſion, and the Biſhops power to Vote in Parliament) <hi>and to the Church of</hi> Scotland: and adjured the Doctor, that <hi>if ever he ſaw Him in a Condition to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that or any of thoſe Vows, he ſhould ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly mind Him of the Obligations, as he dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guilt of the breach ſhould lie upon his own Soul.</hi> This voluntary ſubmiſſion to the Laws of Chriſtianity exceeded that ſo memorable
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:35342:124"/>humiliation of the good Emperour <hi>Theodoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> for he never bewailed the blood of thoſe ſeven thouſand men which in three hour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſpace he cauſed to be ſpilt at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> till the reſolution of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> made him ſenſible of the Crime. But the Piety of King <hi>Charles</hi> anticipated the ſeverity of a Confeſſor for thoſe offences to which He had been preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated by the Violence of others.</p>
            <p>This Zeal and Piety proceeded from the Dedication of His whole Soul to the Honour of His God, for <hi>Religion</hi> was as Imperial in the Intellectual as in the Affectionate Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it. The Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was His not ſo much by Education, as Choice, and He ſo well underſtood the Grounds of it, that He valued them above all other Pretenſions to Truth, and was able to maintain it againſt all its Adverſaries. His Diſcourſe with <hi>Henderſon</hi> ſhews how juſt a Reverence He had for the Authority of the Catholick Church, againſt the Pride and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Schiſmaticks; yet not to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute His Faith to the Adulterations of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Infallibility and Traditions.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the moſt violent Slanders the Faction laboured to pollute Him with, were thoſe that rendred Him inclinable to Popery. From which He was ſo averſe, that He could
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:35342:124"/>not forbear in His indearments to the <hi>Queen,</hi> (when He committed a ſecret to Her Breaſt which He would not truſt to any other, and when He admired and applauded Her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Cares for His Honour and Safety) in a Letter, which He thought no Eye but Hers ſhould have peruſed, to let Her know that He ſtill differ'd from Her in Religion; for He ſays, <hi>It is the only thing of Difference in Opinion betwixt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> Malice made the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers blind, and they publiſhed this Letter to the World, than which there could not be a greater Evidence imaginable of the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt ſecret Thoughts, and Inward Sincerity, nor a more ſhameful Conviction of their Impudence and damnable Falſhood. Nor did He only tell the <hi>Queen</hi> ſo, but He made Her ſee it in His Actions. For as ſoon as His Children were born, it was His firſt Care to prevent the Satisfaction of their Mother in baptizing them after the Rites of Her own Church. When He was to Die, a time moſt ſeaſonable to ſpeak Truth, eſpecially by Him who all His Life knew not how to Diſſemble, He declares His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in Religion to be the ſame with that which He found left by His Father King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How little the Papiſts credited what the Faction would have the World believe, was
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:35342:125"/>too evident by the Conſpiracies of their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> againſt His Life and Honour, which the Diſcovery of <hi>Habernefield</hi> (to whoſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the following practices againſt Him and the Church of <hi>England</hi> gained a belief) brought to light. They were mingled like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe among the Conſpirators, and both heated and directed their Fury againſt Him. They were as importunate in their Calumnies of Him, even after His Death, as were the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of the Sectaries; which they had never done, could they have imagined Him to be theirs; for His Blood would in their Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar have out-ſhined the Multitude of their fictitious Saints. For His ſake they continued their hatred to His Family, abetted the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the following Tyrant, by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the World new <hi>Rules of Obedience and Government,</hi> invented freſh Calumnies for the Son, and obſtructed by various Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods His return to the Principality, becauſe He was Heir as well of the Faith as of the Throne of His Father. Although this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is not to be denied to many Gallant Perſons of that perſwaſion, that their Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not ſo corrupted by their Faith to <hi>Rome,</hi> but that they laboured to prevent the Father's Overthrow, and to haſten the Son's Reſtitution.</p>
            <p>He was not ſatisfied in being Religious as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:35342:125"/>a particular Chriſtian, but would be ſo as a <hi>King,</hi> and indeavoured that Piety might be as Univerſal as His Empire. This He aſſaied by giving Ornaments and Aſſiſtances to the External Exerciſe and Parts of it, (which is the proper Province of a Magiſtrate, whoſe Power reaches but to the Outward man) that ſo carnal minds if they were not brought to an Obedience, might yet to a Reverence, and if men would not honour, yet they ſhould not deſpiſe Religion. This He did in taking Care for the Place of Worſhip, that Comelineſs and Decency ſhould be there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous where the God of Order was to be adored. And it was a Royal Undertaking to reſtore S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church to its primitive ſtrength, and give it a beauty as magnificent as its Structure. He taught men not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the Diſpenſers of the Goſpel, becauſe He had ſo great an eſteem for them, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome to His neareſt Confidence and moſt Private Counſels, as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi> and the greateſt Place of Truſt, as the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to the Treaſury: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting at once the Emolument of Religion, whoſe Dictates are more powerfully impreſſed when the Miniſter is honoured by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; and the Benefit of the State, which wiſe Princes had before found none to ſeek more faithfully, if any did more prudently, than Church-men.</p>
            <pb n="238" facs="tcp:35342:126"/>
            <p> Though a Voluntary Poverty did much contribute to the luſtre and increaſe of the Church in the Purer times, yet a neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted would have deſtroyed it in a Corrupt age; therefore the <hi>King,</hi> to obſtruct all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Ruine that way, ſecured her Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and recovered as much as He could out of the Jaws of Sacrilege, which together with time had devoured a great part of it. His endeavours this way were ſo ſtrong, that the Faction in <hi>Scotland</hi> found no Artifice able to divert them but by kindling the flame of a Civil War; the Criminals there ſeeking to adjuſt their Sacrilegious Acquiſitions by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious practices, and to deſtroy that Church by force which His Majeſty would not ſuffer them to torture with Famine. In <hi>Ireland</hi> the Lord Lieutenant <hi>Wentworth,</hi> by His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Inſtructions, retrived very great Poſſeſſions, which the tumults of that Nation had advantaged many greedy Perſons to ſeize upon, and would not ſuffer Sedition to be incouraged with the hopes of Impiety. In <hi>England</hi> He countenanced thoſe juſt Pleas which Oppreſſed Incumbents entred againſt Rapacious Patrons; and this way many Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were put into a Condition of giving Hoſpitality, who before were contemptible in their Miniſtry, becauſe they were ſo in their Fortune. His Enemies knew how Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:35342:126"/>was the Faith of His Majeſty in this, and therefore preſſed Him with nothing more to obſtruct Peace than the Alienation of Church-Lands, rather than which He did abandon His Life, and parted ſooner with His Blood than them. He uſed to ſay, <hi>Though I am ſenſible enough of the Dangers that attend My Care of the Church, yet I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend it or make it My Tomb-ſtone,</hi> (alluding to a Story which He would tell of a Generous Captain, that ſaid ſo of a Caſtle that was committed to His truſt.) He had ſo perfect a Deteſtation of that Crime, that it is ſaid He ſcarce ever mentioned <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. without an Abhorrency of His Sacriledge. He neglected the Advices of His own Party, if they were negligent of the Welfare of the Church.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Conceſſions He had made in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the prejudice of the Church there, were the ſubject of His grief and penitential Confeſſions both before God (as appears in His Prayers) and men. For when the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>Morley,</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> (whom He had ſent for to the Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where he employed his diligence and prudence to ſearch into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and Reſerves of the Commiſſioners) had acquainted Him how the Commiſſioners were the more pertinacious for the aboliſhing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:35342:127"/>of Epiſcopacy here, becauſe His Majeſty had conſented to it in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and withall told Him what anſwer he himſelf had made to them, That <hi>perchance the King was abuſed to thoſe grants by a miſinformation that that Act which was made in King</hi> James<hi>'s Minority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Biſhops was yet unrepealed, and that His Conceſſion would but leave them where the Law had;</hi> The King Anſwered, <hi>It is true, I was told ſo, but whenever you hear that urged again, give them this anſwer, and ſay, that you had it from the King Himſelf; That when I did that in</hi> Scotland, <hi>I ſinned againſt My Conſcience, and that I have often repented of it, and hope that God hath forgiven Me that great Sin, and by God's grace for no Conſideration in the World will I ever do ſo again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was careful of Uniformity, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He knew the Power of Juſt and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Princes conſiſted in the Union of their Subjects, who never are cemented ſtronger than by a Unity in Religion; but Tyrants, who meaſure their greatneſs by the weakneſs of their Vaſſals, work that moſt effectually by careſſing Schiſms, and giving a Licence to different Perſwaſions (as the Uſurpers after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did:) Beſides, He ſaw <hi>there was no greater Impediment to a ſincere Piety, becauſe that Time and thoſe Parts which might improve Godlineſs to a Growth, were all Waſted and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:35342:127"/>Corrupted in Malice and Slanders betwixt the Diſſenters about forms.</hi> He was more tender in preſerving the Truths of Chriſtianity than the Rights of His Throne. For when the Commiſſioners of the Two Houſes in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> importunately preſſed Him for a Confirmation of the Leſſer <hi>Catechiſm</hi> which the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> had compoſed, and uſed this motive, becauſe it was a ſmall matter; He anſwered, <hi>Though it ſeem to you a ſmall thing, it is not ſo to Me: I had rather give you one of the Flowers of My Crown, than permit your Children to be corrupted in the leaſt point of their Religion.</hi> Thus though He could not infuſe Spiritual Graces into the minds of His Subjects, yet He would manage their Reaſon by Pious Arts; and what the <hi>Example of a King (which through the Corruptions of men is more efficacious to Impiety than to Vertue)</hi> could not do, that His Law ſhould, and He would reſtrain thoſe Vices which He could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> was never uſed by Him to veil Injuſtice; for this was peculiar to His Adverſaries,<note place="margin">His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> who when they were plotting ſuch acts as Hell would bluſh at, they would fawn and ſmile on Heaven; and they uſed it as thoſe ſubtle Surpriſers in War, who wear their Enemies Colours till they be admitted
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:35342:128"/>to butcher them within their own Fortreſſes. But His Majeſty conſulted the Peace of His Conſcience not only in Piety to God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in <hi>Justice</hi> to Men. He was, as a <hi>Magiſtrate ſhould be, a ſpeaking Law.</hi> It was His uſual ſaying, <hi>Let Me ſtand or fall by My own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. I will ever, with</hi> Job, <hi>rather chuſe Miſery than Sin.</hi> He firſt ſubmitted His Counſels to the Cenſure of the Lawyers before they were brought forth to Execution. Thoſe Acts of which the Faction made moſt noiſe, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Judges to be within the Sphere of the Prerogative. The cauſes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue were as freely debated as private Pleas, and ſometimes decreed to be not good; which can never happen under a bad Prince. The Juſtice of His Times ſhewed that of His Breaſt, wherein the Laws were feared and not Men. None were forced to purchaſe their Liberty with the diminution of their Eſtates, or the loſs of their Credit. Every one had both ſecurity and ſafety for His Life, Fortune, and Dignity; and it was not then thought, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, to be a part of Wiſdom to provide againſt Dangers by obſcurity and Privacies. His Favours in beſtowing Great Offices never ſecured the Receivers from the force of the Law, but Equity overcame His Indulgences. For He knew that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt Princes become O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to them that made them ſo.</hi> He ſubmitted the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventrey</hi> to an Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:35342:128"/>when a querulous perſon had accuſed him of Bribery. He ſharply reproved one whom He had made Lord Treaſurer, when he was petitioned againſt by an <hi>Hampſhire</hi> Knight, on whoſe Eſtate, being held by Leaſe from the Crown, that Treaſurer had a deſign; and He ſecured the Petitioner in his Right. The greateſt Officer of His Court did not dare to do any the leaſt of thoſe injuries which the moſt Contemptible Member of the Houſe of Commons would with a daily Inſolency act upon His weaker Neighbour. In the Civil Diſcords He bewailed nothing more, than that the Sword of Juſtice could not correct the illegal Furies of that of War. Though by His Conceſſions and Grants He diminiſhed His Power, yet He thought it a Compenſation, to let the World ſee He was willing to make it impoſſible for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy to have an unjuſt Inſtrument, and to ſecure Poſterity from Evil Kings. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though He proved to a Leading Lord of the Faction, <hi>That a People being too cautious to bind their King by Laws from doing Ill, do likewiſe fetter Him from doing Good, and their fears of Miſchief do deſtroy their hopes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. And that ſuch is the weakneſs of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that he which is intruſted only to Good, may pervert that Power to the extremeſt. Ills.</hi> And indeed there is no ſecurity for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to feel nothing in Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:35342:129"/>the Advantages of it, but in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of Providence, and the Juſtice of the Prince, both which we enjoyed while we enjoyed Him.</p>
            <p>Though He was thus in Love with Juſtice, yet He ſuffered not that to leven His Nature to Severity and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,<note place="margin">His Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</note> but tempered it with <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,</hi> eſpecially when His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could poſſibly find out ſuch an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the Offence, that it ſtruck more at His Peculiar than the Publick Intereſt. He ſeemed almoſt ſtupid in the Opinion of Cholerick Spirits as to a ſenſe of His own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, when there was no fear leſt His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould thereby increaſe the Miſeries of His People. And He was ſo ambitious of the Glory of Moderation, that He would acquire it in deſpight of the Malignity of the times. For <hi>the Exerciſe of this Vertue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not only on the temper of the Prince, but the frame of the People muſt contribute to it; becauſe when the Reverence of Majeſty and fear of the Laws are proſcribed, ſharper Methods are required to form Obedience.</hi> Yet He was unwilling to cut off, till He had tried by Mercy to amend, even guilty Souls. Thus He ſtrove to oblige the Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi> to peaceful practices, by continuing that Life which had been employed in Sedition, and forfeited to the Law.</p>
            <pb n="245" facs="tcp:35342:129"/>
            <p> Soon after His coming into the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> (by which time He had experienced the numerous Frauds and implacable Malice of His Enemies) being attended on by Dr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (for they were the earlieſt in their Duties at that time) a Diſcourſe paſſed betwixt His Majeſty and the Governour, wherein there was mention made of the fears of the Faction that the King could never forgive them. To which the King immediately replyes, <hi>I tell thee, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, I can forgive them with as good an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite as ever I eat My Dinner after an hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that I aſſure you was not a ſmall one; yet I will not make My ſelf a better Chriſtian than I am, for I think if they were Kings I could not do it ſo eaſily.</hi> This ſhewed how prone His Soul was to Mercy, and found not any obſtruction but what aroſe from a ſenſe of Royal Magnanimity.</p>
            <p>He ſooner offered and gave life to His cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Enemies than their Spirits debauched by Rebellion would require it, and He was ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that blood of which their fury made them Prodigal. No man fell in battel whom He could ſave. He choſe rather to enjoy any Victory by Peace (and therefore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſollicited for it when He ſeemed leaſt to need it) than make one triumph a ſtep to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:35342:130"/>another; and though He was paſſionate to put all in Safety, yet He affected rather to end the War by Treaty than by Conqueſt The Priſoners He took He uſed like deluded men, and oftner remembred that God had made them His Subjects, than that the Faction had transformed them to Rebels. He provided for them while in His Power, and not to let them languiſh in Priſon, ſent them by Paſſer to their own homes, only ingaging them by Oath to no more injuries againſt that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign whom they had felt to be Gracious: for ſo He uſed thoſe that were taken at <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> But yet the Caſuiſt of the Cauſe would ſoon diſpenſe with their Faith, and ſend them forth to die in contracting a new guilt. Thoſe whom the fury of War had left gaſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Field, and fainting under their wounds, He commends in His Warrants, (as in that to the Mayor of <hi>Newbury</hi>) to the care of the Neighbourhood, either tenderly to recover, or decently bury: and His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were as well for thoſe that ſought to murther Him as thoſe that were wounded in His Defence.</p>
            <p>This made the Impudence and Falſhood of <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> more portentous, when in his Speech of the Aſſaſſination he belch'd out thoſe Compariſons of <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Nero:</hi> the firſt would kill numbers of Senators to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:35342:130"/>make himſelf Sport, and the laſt thought it juſt enough that <hi>Paetus Thraſeas</hi> ſhould die, becauſe he look'd like a School-maſter. But this <hi>Prince</hi>'s Anger was without Danger to any, His Admonitions were frequent, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections ſeldom, but Revenge never. He grieved when His Pity had not Power or Skill to ſave Offenders, and then He puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bad, but yet gave them ſpace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and make their Execution as near as He could like a natural Death, to tranſlate them from hence to a place where they could not Sin. He had nothing of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in Him, which <hi>Machiavel</hi> requires in ſuch Princes as make Succeſs the only end of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and conſult a proſperous Grandeur more than an unſpotted Conſcience. He ſcorned to abuſe the Character of God upon Him by turning a <hi>Fox</hi> to diſſemble, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to think that He whom Heaven had made above other men ſhould degenerate to the Cruelty of a <hi>Lyon.</hi> He ſooner parted with Mortality than Mercy; for He ended His days with a Prayer for His Enemies, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to make His Clemency immortal, by commanding the practice of it to His Son.</p>
            <p>None of His Vertues were in the Confines of Vice, and therefore this Admirable Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency proceeded not from a defect of Spirit,<note place="margin">His Fortitude.</note> as His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:35342:131"/>tractors imputed it, and <hi>the Vulgar,</hi> who <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake Cruelty for Valour,</hi> imagined; but like the Bowels of the Supremeſt Mercy which are incircled with an Infinite Power, ſo the Pity to guilty and frail men was attended with an Incomparable <hi>Fortitude.</hi> For this Vertue conſiſting in deſpiſing Dangers and Enemies in thoſe Cauſes that render Death comely and glorious, the <hi>King</hi> gave ſeveral Evidences of a Contempt of all Power be. neath that of Heaven.

               </gap> Chamber that Night: while the ſollicitous Court admired, and even cenſured, His Magnanimity, for it went beyond His pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and did more than that Emperour who
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:35342:131"/>was ſtiled the <hi>Delight of Mankind,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of a Conſpiracy againſt him, invited the two Chiefs of it to accompany him to the <hi>Spectacula,</hi> and cauſed them both to ſit next on each ſide to him in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre; and to give them more advantage for their deſign, put the ſwords of the <hi>Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> (under colour of enquiring their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning their ſharpneſs) into their hands, to ſhew how little dread he had of their fury. But the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince's Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity exceeded that of the Excellent <hi>Roman</hi>'s, as much as the privacies of a Bed-Chamber, and the darkneſs of Night make up a fitter Scene for the Aſſaſſination of a beloved Soveraign than a publick Theatre.</p>
            <p>As He never provoked War, ſo He never feared it; and when the miſerable Neceſſity lay upon Him to take up Arms to preſerve Himſelf from an unjuſt Violence, He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much if not more Valour than thoſe can boaſt of that with equal force finiſhed Wars with Conqueſt: in the ſucceſs of theſe, Fortune, the Vanity of an Enemy, and the aſſiſtances of Friends may challenge a part of the Praiſe, but in that none but His own brave Soul had the Glory. For to attempt at Victory againſt an Enemy that had almoſt more Forts and Garriſons than He had Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to joyn with Him, that with Cannon
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:35342:132"/>out-vied the Number of his Muskets, that had gotten from Him a Navy which His Care had made the moſt formidable in the World, and not left Him the command of a Cock-boat, that were prodigal with the Treaſure of a Nation and His Revenues, when He begged for a ſubſiſtence; was ſuch a Courage that would have made that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> of Gallant Perſons, who were the moſt competent Judges of Valour, and never cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Vertue by the Succeſs, but thanked their Imprudent <hi>Conſul</hi> for not deſpairing of the Commonwealth, when he gathered up thoſe broken Legions which his Raſhneſs had obtruded to an Overthrow, to have decreed a Triumph for <hi>CHARLES,</hi> had His life been an Honour to that Age, or could thoſe Generations have reckoned Him among their great Examples. Moſt men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thought the <hi>King</hi>'s ſide moſt glorious, yet they concluded the other more terrible: thoſe that minded their Duty were in the Royal Camp, but ſuch as cared for Safety took part with the Faction, or at leaſt did not oppoſe them. As He firſt entred the War, ſo did He continue in it. His Moderation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moved Him to deſire Peace, and His Fortitude made them ſometimes ſue for it. His Adverſaries never prevailed upon His Fears, but upon the Treachery and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of ſome of His Party, who could
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:35342:132"/>not endure an Honourable Want: and on ſuch their Gold was ſtronger than their Iron on Him, and He was rather Betrayed than Overcome.</p>
            <p>His Greatneſs of Mind forſook Him not with His Fortune, Arms and Liberty, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Natural, and not built upon them; this made Him tenacious of Majeſty when His Power was gone. For when <hi>Whaley,</hi> that had the Command of the Guards upon Him while He was in the Army, inſolently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded into His Preſence to hear His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with a Foreign Miniſter of State, and being bold in his Power and Office, refuſed to obey the Command for a greater Diſtance, the <hi>King</hi> caned him to an Obſervance. When the Parricides ſent their party of Soldiers to force Him from the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> to the Slaughter, <hi>Cobbet</hi> that commanded them thruſt himſelf into the Coach with Him: but the <hi>King</hi> ſenſible that the nearneſs of ſuch a Villain was like a Contagion to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, with His Hand forced him away to herd among his bloody fellows. His Spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept above the barbarous Malice of His Enemies, and of their rudeſt Injuries would ſeem unſenſible. He told a faithful Servant of His, that the Conſpirators had kept Him for two Months under a want of Linen and Shirts: <hi>But</hi> (ſaid He) <hi>I ſcorned to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:35342:133"/>give them that pleaſure as to tell them I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Thus all the ſtrokes of Fortune upon His Magnanimous Soul were but like the breaking of Waves upon a Rock of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, which cannot ſhake, but only waſh it to a greater Brightneſs.</p>
            <p>But though He knew not how to ſubmit to the Power of Men,<note place="margin">His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note> yet He would tremble under the Frowns of God. His great Spirit made Him not unquiet or furious under the Corrections of the Almighty: But with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Patience (a Vertue not uſual with Kings, to whom the bounds of Equity ſeem a reſtraint, and therefore are more reſtleſs in Injuries)</hi> He did ſubmit to the Will of His eternal Sovereign. He never murmured nor repined at that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which had given Him plenty of tears to drink: But His Meditations ſtill breath the Juſtice of God and the Holineſs of all His ways with Him. He would take Occaſions from diſpleaſing Occurrences to thank God that had fitted Him for the Condition he had brought Him unto. For when He marched after His Carriage in purſuit of <hi>Eſſex</hi> into the Weſt, one of them broke in a very narrow Lane, which made Him ſtop till an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Showre of Rain came pouring upon Him; from which that He might ſeek for a Shelter in the Neighbouring Village, His
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:35342:133"/>Courtiers offered to hew Him out a way through the Hedge with their Swords, but He refuſed: and when they wondred at it, He lifting up His hat and Eyes to worſhip the Fountain of All Grace, ſaid, <hi>As God hath given me Afflictions to exerciſe My Patience, ſo He hath given me Patience to bear My Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi> The Indignity He received from <hi>Hotham</hi> provoked no Curſe from Him, nor could the Injuries from <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> move Him to any thing more than Prayers for God's ſanctifying them to Him. He wanted not Temptations to Paſſion from His own Party; for in a Letter to the <hi>Queen,</hi> He tells Her that She could not but Pity Him in His Condition as to them: yet He ſo managed their ſeveral Humours, and ſo cheriſhed their Expectations with Patience and Meekneſs, that they quietly waited for a return of His Fortune.</p>
            <p>When He was in His Captivity at <hi>Caris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> under the ſtricteſt Reſtraint, thoſe that attended Him never almoſt obſerved Him but chearful and pleaſant in His Diſcourſes, and ſometimes breaking out into pleaſing Reparties and Jeſts. When in the Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> (where He had occaſions of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion daily adminiſtred by the Perverſeneſs to Peace of the Party He was to deal with) one of the Commiſſioners was importunate
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:35342:134"/>with Him for more Conceſſions and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him of His ſaying, <hi>That if there were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treaty, it ſhould not lie in the power of the Devil's Malice to hinder Peace:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> anſwered, <hi>It would be ſo when there was a Treaty, but as for this it could not be thought a Treaty, but He was like the man in the Play, that cryed out he had been in a Fray, and when they asked him what Fray, he replyed there was a Fray and no Fray, for there were but three blows given, and he took them all: So this is a Treaty and not a Treaty, for there be many Conceſſions, but I have made them all.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, when He met one of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Miniſters near His Chamber enquiring for Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> (who then waited on Him, and had been faithful to Him in that Service) the <hi>King</hi> told him, <hi>He wondred he would have any more to do either with</hi> Titus <hi>or</hi> Timothy, <hi>ſince he fared ſo ill in medling with them in his Diſputes about Epiſcopacy the day before.</hi> Theſe ſhewed how free His Soul was, and uncontrolled in the greateſt and moſt diſpleaſing perplexities.</p>
            <p>He would never take any indirect courſes to avoid the Croſs, nay, He ſcrupled at ſuch expedients as ſome deemed moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to His great end. For at the Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> there being offered to Him an expedient, to ſecure His Conſcience
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:35342:134"/>and ſatisfie the Commiſſioners in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions about the Church, and it being urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a great and faithful Counſellour, that He muſt grant what poſſibly he could to preſerve His own Life for the good of the Church, for (it was ſaid) her ſafety depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on His; with a preſent and pious indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation He replyed, <hi>Tell not Me what I ſhould do for ſaving of My Life, but what I may do with a ſafe Conſcience: God forbid that the Life or Safety of the Church ſhould depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on My Life, or upon the Life of any mortal man; and I thank God I have a Son whom I have reaſon to believe will love the Church as well as I do.</hi> Another time, a little after the Treaty was ended, Dr. <hi>Morley</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Him a billet he had received by the Lady <hi>Wheeler</hi> the King's Laundreſs (who often conveyed much Intelligence) from an Officer of the Army, that the King's Death was reſolved on; His Majeſty anſwered, <hi>I have done what I can to ſave My Life without loſing of my Soul. I can do, I will do no more: God's will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Pomp of His Murther, wherein He was made a Spectacle to the World, Angels and Men, no Tryals were ever greater, nor ever were any better born: the Parricides found it was eaſie to take away His Life, but impoſſible His Honour and Patience; His
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:35342:135"/>Paſſions being then ſo low and quiet, that the natural Infirmity of His Speech did not in the leaſt meaſure appear, which uſes to be moſt evident in the ſmalleſt diſcompoſure of the Spirit. After the Regicides had paſſed their Decree for His Aſſaſſination, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him to be perſecuted with all the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the fanatick Souldiers, there fell from Him nothing like Paſſion or Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but that He gave the Authors of thoſe Impieties the title that was due to them: for when my Lord of <hi>London</hi> came to Him, (which was not till eight a Clock on Saturday Night,) He told him, <hi>My Lord, that you came no ſooner I believe was not your fault; but now you are come, becauſe theſe Rogues purſue My Blood, you and I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult how I may beſt part with it.</hi> Yet even this was ſpoken without any Fury or Violence; for though all about Him was tumultuous with Horror, Deſtruction and Contempt, His Soul ſeemed unconcerned, enjoyed a Calm Serenity, and was full of its own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. This Vertue made Him forget He was a <hi>Prince</hi> born to Command, and only conſider that He was a Chriſtian whoſe Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling obliges to Suffer.</p>
            <p>He had found out a way to Glory by <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi> For <hi>the ſupreme Power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Humility.</note> 
               <hi>to which nothing can be added,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:35342:135"/>hath no better way to encreaſe, than when ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of its own Greatneſs it humbleth it ſelf. And the Dignity of Princes is in nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Envy and Danger than in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> He deſpiſed the converſe of none, though poor, if honeſt: He ſhewed to Sir <hi>Philip Warwick</hi> (who had much of His Truſt and Affections) in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> a poor ragged Old Man, and told him <hi>he was a very honeſt fellow, and had been His beſt Company for two months together.</hi> He would have thoſe about Him converſe rather with Himſelf than with His Majeſty, and with them would He mingle Diſcourſes as One of the People: none made an end of ſpeaking till His own Modeſty, not Pride in the <hi>King,</hi> thought it was enough: and He never did contradict any man without this mollifying Preface, <hi>By your favour, Sir.</hi> His diſcourſe as it was familiar, ſo it was directed to raiſe thoſe that heard it to a nearer approach to Himſelf by perfection; for He did not proudly ſcoff at, but gently laboured to mend the defects of His Subjects. When Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> had in ſome degree loſt the Manage of His Voice, His Majeſty ſhewed him his Infirmity, and taught him to amend it; which that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſon often mentioned as an inſtance of a Gracious Condeſcenſion of Majeſty. When Noble Youths came to take their leaves of Him before they went to foreign
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:35342:136"/>travel, He would not let them go without His Inſtructions, of which this was one, <hi>My Lord, Keep alwayes the beſt Company, and be ſure never to be Idle.</hi> Thus He would confer the Vertues as well as the Titles of Nobility, He laboured to keep them as Majeſty had made them, and that that blood might not be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them which was honoured in their Anceſtors. Nor did He deſire that they ſhould be otherwiſe than He directed, as <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and weak Princes will commend thoſe Vertues which they are afraid of, for they dread or envy their Subjects Parts and Abilities. Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves that a <hi>Tyrant</hi> cares not to hear his Vaſſals ſpeak any thing that is either Grave or Generous; and it is reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Uſurpations of ſuch Monſters, that they would have the opinion to be the Only <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Gallant. Plato</hi> indangered his Life when he converſed with the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, becauſe he was thought to underſtand more than his Hoſt. It was obſerved of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> (by one of his confident Teachers) that in the time of his Tyranny he loved no man that ſpoke Senſe, and had ſeveral Artifices to diſparage it among his Slaves that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and he would highly extol thoſe Pulpit-Speakers that had moſt Canting and leaſt Reaſon. But the <hi>King</hi> thought it the Honour of Principality to rule over Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſons, and affected to be Great only
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:35342:136"/>by being Better; and to raiſe their Spirits would ſtoop with His own.</p>
            <p>Of theſe He always choſe the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed that He knew, to be His Miniſters of State and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Confidents:<note place="margin">His Choice of Miniſters of State.</note> for as <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Princes ſtands in need of many Friends, which are the ſureſt ſupports of Empire;</hi> ſo He would always ſeek the Beſt, and thoſe He thought fitteſt for His Employments, which a bad or weak <hi>King</hi> would hate or fear. Therefore He had always the fineſt Pens and ableſt Heads in His Cauſe, and Perſons likewiſe of Integrity in His Service: for the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that were clamoured againſt as the greateſt Criminals, were not guilty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, even by thoſe accuſations which they were loaded with, and yet not proved, to receive the Cenſure of the Law, but were to be condemned in an unaccuſtomed way of ſpilling <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood. When ſome diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Abilities even by oppoſing His Counſels, He preferr'd the Publick Benefit which might be by their Endowments to His private Injuries; He would either buy them off to His Service by ſome Place of Truſt, or win them to His Friendſhip; unleſs He ſaw them to be ſuch whoſe Natures were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by their Deſigns, (for He had a moſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:35342:137"/>excellent Sagacity in diſcerning the Spirits of men) or they were ſuch who polluted their parts by proſtituting Religion to ſome baſe ends (the injuries of which He could never neglect:) and ſuch He neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Honourable in a Court, nor hoped they would ever be faithful and quiet in a Community. Among theſe Purchaces were reckoned the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> and others now living, whoſe Perfections honoured His Judgment, and juſtified His Choice.</p>
            <p>He had no Favorite, as a Miniſter of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to gratifie whoſe Luſts and Vanities He might be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to do things contrary to the benefit of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;<note place="margin">His Affection to His People.</note> but all were Inſtruments of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and muſt be able to ſerve the Publick, whom He took to ſerve Himſelf. For no Prince was ever more affectionate of His People than He was, nor did He think His Intereſt ſeparate from theirs. Thoſe nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, and cautious limits of Prerogative and Liberty which the Faction invented to enjealous the People with, were all indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly compriſed by Him in an Uniform and Conſtant care of a juſt Government: none dared to adviſe Him to attempt at a power His Predeceſſors had parted with, or the

Nor was He ever more pleaſed than in the enjoyment of it: When His Third Parliament granted five Subſidies, and it was told Him that <hi>there was not One Voice diſſenting,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He wept for joy;</hi> and it had been happy for the People, if the <hi>King</hi> had always had ſuch cauſe of Tears, and His Eyes had been always wet with the ſame.</p>

            <p> Conteſts for Liberty could never have been more unſeaſonable than under this <hi>Prince,</hi> for He never denied His Subjects the removal of any juſt Grievance, yea, He part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometimes, through their own importunity deluded by the Faction, with that which ſhould have kept them Free: And when He made ſuch Conceſſions which tended to the prejudice of thoſe that deſired it, He would ſay to ſome about Him, that <hi>He would never have granted theſe things, but that He hoped they would ſee the Inconvenience of that power which they begg'd from Him, yet themſelves could not manage, and return it to its proper place, before it became their Ruine.</hi> He was far from the ambition of <hi>Ill Princes</hi> to <hi>ſeek as unlimited power;</hi> but He thought it <hi>the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the beſt Sovereign to ſet bounds to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> He deſpiſed His Life if it were to be bought by the Miſery of the Nation, and therefore rejected the Propoſitions of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as the Conditions of His Safety, when ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Him the day before His Murther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would inſlave the People.

            <p>As He was to the Publick ſo to His Private Obligations. No aſſaults could take the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> from His Protection: for though His foreign Enterpriſes required ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Money, and the Faction would not let the Bills for Subſidies paſs unleſs they might be gratified with the Dukes blood, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation from His Truſt, the <hi>King</hi> would not buy them with the Life or Diſhonour of His Friend. And although he fell afterwards as a Sacrifice to the Common hate, (for ſo the Aſſaſſinate pretended, that he might give a Splendor to his Crime, <hi>It being more ſpecious to revenge the Publick than private Injuries,</hi>) yet was he not the <hi>King</hi>'s Offering. In the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> this Honour ſeemed to be clouded: But Poſterity will ſee that Noble Perſon was rather raviſhed from Him, (on deſign by his Enemies to rob him of the Glory of Fidelity,) than deſerted by Him; for He never left him till the Earl did abandon himſelf. And a Penitence for a Submiſſion (not Conſent) to the Rape made a Satisfaction for the Offence, and repaired the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:35342:140"/>damage of the Injury. For His Majeſties Tears over him will embalm and preſerve his name and blood to the honour of Following Ages more than the remnant of his days would have adminiſtred to his Glory.</p>
            <p>It would be an Injury to His other Vertues to mention His <hi>Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Chaſtity.</note> becauſe it is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy to be otherwiſe; unleſs to let Poſterity know, that no injured Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band nor Diſhonoured Family conſpired to His Ruine, but ſuch who were engaged to Him for preſerving all their Rights in thoſe Relations unattempted, and ſecuring them by His own example. He witneſſed His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal <hi>Chaſtity</hi> the day before His Death, (a time not to be ſpent in falſities, which was too little for neceſſary Preparations to appear before the God of Truth;) when He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to tell her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that <hi>His thoughts had never ſtrayed from Her, and His Love ſhould be the ſame to the Laſt.</hi> The purity of His Speech likewiſe teſtified the Cleanneſs of His Heart, for He did abhor all Obſcene and wanton Diſcourſe, And He was ſo far from defiling the Beds, that He would not pollute the Ears of His Subjects.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Chaſtity</hi> found no Aſſaults from Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,

He always mingled Water with His Wine, which He never drank pure but when He eat Veniſon; and He was ſo nice in obſerving the bounds of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> that moſt times Himſelf would meaſure and mingle both together. He did uſually at every Meal drink one Glaſs of Beer, another of Wine, and a third of Water, and ſeldom drank between His Meals. Theſe though Ordinary Vertues, were yet eminent in Him, ſince they could not be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Power nor the Flatteries of Fortune. And they are therefore mentioned to gratifie Poſterity; for <hi>men are curious to know all, even the minute Paſſages of Great and Vertuous Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being free from Incontinency and Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the gulphs of Treaſure and Drayners of the Largeſt Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,<note place="margin">His Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.</note> He had no other Vice to exhauſt the Publick Stock, and ſo neceſſitate Him to fill it up by Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but He would by <hi>Frugality</hi> make His
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:35342:141"/>Revenue ſufficient for the Majeſty of the Crown, and the Neceſſities of the State. His own Nature indeed inclined Him to Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, but the Vices of others did inſtruct Him to moderate Expences. For He had found the Treaſury low, and the Debts great, in His beginnings: He was aſſaulted with two expenſive Wars from the two great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Faction had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the uſual way of Supplies by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore He was to find a Mine in Vertue; and by ſparing from Vanities, make proviſions for neceſſary and glorious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, which He did effect: for in that ſhort time of Peace, which He enjoyed, He ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all the Publick Debts, ſo furniſhed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed His Navy, that it was the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the whole World, ſupported His Conſederate the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and by Money inabled him for the Victories of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and ſo fill'd His own Treaſury, that it was able of it ſelf to bear the weight of the firſt <hi>Scotch</hi> Expedition without the Aids of the Subject, who were never more able to contribute to their own ſafety, nor ever had more reaſon, the ſwellings of that Nation breaking all the Banks and Fences of their Liberty and Happineſs. But the <hi>King</hi> would let them ſee that as by His Government He had made them rich, He would alſo keep them ſo by His Frugality. But thoſe whoſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:35342:142"/>firſt care was to make Him neceſſitous, and the next odious, did brand it with the name of Covetouſneſs, which was as Falſe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious; For He never ſpared when Juſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns call'd for Expences, and was magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in Noble Undertakings, as in the Repair of <hi>Paul</hi>'s. He was always Grateful, although thoſe men who meaſured their Services not by their Duties, or their Merits, but by their Expectations from His Fortune, thought Him not Liberal. He choſe rather not to burthen His People by Subſidies, than load particular Servants with unequal Bounties. For <hi>Good Princes chuſe to be loved rather for their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to the Community than for thoſe to private perſons. And it may be Vanity and Oſtentation, but not Liberality, when the gifts of the Prince are not proportioned to the Common Neceſſity.</hi> His ſparings were like thoſe of Indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that His Subjects as Children might have the more. He never, like ſubtle and rapacious Kings, made or pretended a Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for Taxes, but was troubled when He found it. The Contributions of Parliament He eſteemed not the increaſe of His peculiar Treaſure, but the Proviſions for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Safety, of which He would rather be accounted a Steward than a Lord. When Faction and Sedition ſo deluded the People that they could not ſee the preſervation of the whole conſiſted in contributing ſome ſmall
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:35342:142"/>part, He freely parted with His own Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to preſerve intire to them the price of their Sweat and Labour.</p>
            <p>As He had theſe Moral Vertues, which are both the ſignatures of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,<note place="margin">His Intellectual Abilities.</note> and the Ornaments of a Royal Spirit, ſo He was no leſs compleat in the Intellectual. His Underſtanding was as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive as His Juſt Power, and He was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of more ſorts of Knowledge than He was of Nations. How much He knew of the Myſteries and Controverſies of Divinity was evident in His Diſcourſes and Papers with <hi>Henderſon,</hi> and thoſe at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> where He ſingly Diſputed for <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> one whole day againſt Fifteen Commiſſioners and their Four Chaplains, (the moſt experienced and ſubtle members of all the Oppoſite Party) with ſo much Acuteneſs and Felicity, that even His Oppoſers admired Him. He ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly managed His Diſcourſe with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that He made it evident they perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him to that which they themſelves judged unlawful, and had condemned as Sacriledge, when they pretended to ſatisfie the Scruples of His Conſcience, and to aſſure Him He might ſafely alienate the Church-Lands. And the Commiſſioners ſenſible how unequal their Miniſters were to diſcourſe with Him, for
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:35342:143"/>ever after ſilenced them, and permitted no Diſputes but by Papers. At that time He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the opinion of His friends about Him. One of them ſaid in aſtoniſhment, that <hi>Certainly God had inſpired Him.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>His Majeſty was to a Wonder im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by His Privacies and Afflictions.</hi> But a third, that had had the Honour of a nearer Service, aſſured them that the <hi>King was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leſs, only He had now the opportunity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in His full Magnitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Law of the Land He was as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as Himſelf ſaid to the Parricides, yet was no boaſter of His own Parts) as any Gentleman in <hi>England,</hi> who did not profeſs the Publick Practice of it: eſpecially thoſe Parts of it which concerned the Commerce between <hi>King</hi> and People. In that Art which is peculiar to Princes, <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi> He knew as much as the moſt proſperous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary <hi>Kings,</hi> or their moſt exerciſed Miniſters, yet ſcorned to follow thoſe Rules of it which lead from the Paths of Juſtice. The Reſerves that other Princes uſed in their Leagues and Contracts, to colour the breaches of Faith, and thoſe inglorious and dark In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of ſubtle Politicians, He did perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhor: but His Letters, Declarations, Speeches, Meditations, are full of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Wiſdom which is conſiſtent with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:35342:143"/>He had ſo quick an Inſight into theſe Myſteries, and ſo early arrived to the Knowledge of it, that when He was young, and had juſt gotten out of the Court and Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> He cenſured the weakneſs of that Myſterious Council. For He was no ſooner on Shipboard, but the firſt words He ſpake were, <hi>I diſcovered two Errors in thoſe great Maſters of Policy; One that they would uſe Me ſo Ill, and another that after ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage they permitted Me to Depart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As thoſe former parts of Knowledge did inable Him to know <hi>Men,</hi> and how to manage their different humours,<note place="margin">His Skill in all Arts.</note> and to temper them to a fitneſs for Society, and make them ſerviceable to the Glory of that God whoſe Miniſter He was: ſo His Soul was ſtored with a full Knowledge of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Things,</hi> and eaſily comprehended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all kinds of Arts that either were for Delight or of a Publick Uſe; for He was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of nothing but of what He thought it became Him to be negligent, (for many parts of Learning that are for the Ornament of a Private perſon are beneath the Cares of a Crowned Head.) He was well skilled in things of Antiquity, could judge of Meddals whether they had the number of years they pretended unto; His Libraries and Cabinets
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:35342:144"/>were full of thoſe things on which length of Time put the Value of Rarities. In Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing He had ſo excellent a Fancy, that He would ſupply the defect of Art in the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſuddenly draw thoſe Lines, give thoſe Airs and Lights, which Experience and Practice had not taught the Painter. He could judge of Fortifications, and cenſure whether the Cannon were mounted to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution or no. He had an excellent Skill in Guns, knew all that belonged to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The exacteſt Arts of building Ships for the moſt neceſſary uſes of ſtrength or good ſailing, together with all their furniture, were not unknown to Him. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and was pleaſed with the making of Clocks and Watches. He comprehended the Art of Printing. There was not any one Gentleman of all the three Kingdoms that could compare with Him in an Univerſality of Knowledge. He incouraged all the Parts of Learning, and He delighted to talk with all kind of Artiſts, and with ſo great a Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity did apprehend the Myſteries of their Profeſſions, that He did ſometime ſay, <hi>He thought He could get His Living, if Neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by any Trade He knew of, but making of Hangings:</hi> although of theſe He underſtood much, and was greatly delighted in them; for He brought ſome of the moſt curious Workmen from Foreign Parts to make them here in <hi>England.</hi>

            <pb n="275" facs="tcp:35342:144"/>
            <p> His Writings ſhew what Notions He had gathered from the whole ſtore of Learning, which He cloathed with a Wonderful and moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Eloquence.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Eloquence.</note> Which was unqueſtionably ſo great, that thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to deſpoil Him of His Civil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions granted Him a deſerved Empire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong famous Writers. The Book of His Meditations is alone ſufficient to make His Aſſaſſinates execrable to all that in any Age ſhall have a ſenſe of Piety, or a love to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Eloquence. <hi>For ſo great an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Breaſts of men do excellent Writings acquire for their Authors, that though they may be otherwiſe blameable, yet their Works render their Memories precious; and the violent Deaths of ſuch increaſe their Glory, while they load their Murtherers with Ignominy.

So that all future times ſhall admire and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pland His Writings againſt them, and curſe their Injuſtice to Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Wiſdom was not only Speculative in His Writings,<note place="margin">His Political Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> but alſo Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in His Counſels. None
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:35342:145"/>found out better means for accompliſhing a Deſign, provided ſafer expedients for the Reſſorts of Difficulties, or more clearly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the Event at a Diſtance; nor were any Counſels ſo proſperous as His own, when they were vigorouſly proſecuted by thoſe whom He intruſted with the Execution; and He ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom miſcarried but when He inclined to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Advices of others; as He did in that inauſpicious Attempt to take <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in He forſook His own Reaſons, which He urged with all poſſible Evidence of Succeſs, to march towards <hi>London.</hi> He ſaw into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues of His Enemies; and had not the Treacheries (which being ſecret are above the Caution of Humane Nature) of ſome that followed Him opened to them His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, He had (by the Ordinary Courſe of Providence) covered them with the ſhame both of Imprudence and Overthrow. Thoſe Miſeries that the Faction after they got into Power brought upon the Nation, and the Events of their deſtructive Enterpriſes, were diſcovered and foretold by Him in the very beginnings to the deluded World, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding were Fatally blinded to chuſe their own Ruine.</p>
            <p>Whenſoever His Secretaries had drawn up, by the Direction of the <hi>Council,</hi> Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or any other Papers, and offered them to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:35342:145"/>his peruſal, though both they and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had done their parts, yet He would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with His own hand correct them both as to Matter and Form; He commonly uſing theſe words when He took the Pen in His hand, <hi>Come, I am a good Cobler:</hi> and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections were acknowledged by them all to be both for the greater luſtre and advantage of the Writings. His Inſtructions to His Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, Commiſſioners, Deputies, were ſo full of Wiſdom, and ſuch prudent proviſions for all the Reſſorts of thoſe they were to treat with, that there was nothing to be ſupplyed on their parts to make their Negotiations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but ſeaſonable Applications, or a fortune to deal with reaſonable men. It was the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a Noble Perſon (who was dear to Him for his Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs, and was of His Council in all His Troubles) that <hi>bad the King been a Counſellor to any other Prince, He would have gained the Eſteem of an Oracle,</hi> all His Propoſals being grounded upon the greateſt Reaſon, and proper to the Buſineſs conſulted about. Thoſe that have been forward to interpret His Actions by the Succeſs, and from thence have proceeded to the Cenſure of His Prudence, conſidered not the numerous Difficulties in forming any Reſolution, nor the fallacious repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Affairs to Him, but only looked upon His unproſperous Reſolves according
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:35342:146"/>to the Fate of unhappy Counſels, which is <hi>to have that condemned, which was put in Execution, and that praiſed as beſt which was never tryed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was He made for Empire as well as born unto it; and had all thoſe Excellencies,<note place="margin">The Cenſure of His Fortune.</note> which, if we had been free to chuſe, muſt have determined our Election of a Sovereign to Him alone, there being nothing wanting in Him that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Cenſors of Princes do number among the Requiſites of a compleat Monarch. It was therefore the wonder of thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every man to be the Artificer of His own Fortune, how it came to paſs that He had not that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an uninterrupted cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Succeſs (which ſome men reckon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the conſtitutives of Happineſs) in all His Enterpriſes. To Others that impute all our affairs here below to an inviolable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Decrees of Heaven, which yet they acknowledge juſt, though dark, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the Riddles of Providence, that a <hi>King</hi> of ſo great Vertues ſhould yet be cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous: for let Poſterity judge how great and how good this <hi>Prince</hi> was, that could not be ruined even after a <hi>War</hi> (which <hi>uſually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters the Spirits of thoſe that are moleſted by it</hi>) and a total <hi>Overthrow (whoſe common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:35342:146"/>is Contempt)</hi> but by ſo various and ſuch wicked Arts; and was judged by all men, though He wanted, yet <hi>to deſerve Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity (as to humane judgment,)</hi> which (as ſome think) <hi>is the trueſt Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe Doubts there appears no Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo obvious as that into the Pleaſure of the Divine Majeſty, who provoked by our ſins, which had profaned his Mercies, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the Peace and Plenty he gave us, would chaſtiſe us by the ſcourge of Civil War, the corrective of too much felicity, and taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the beſt of <hi>Kings</hi> leave us to the Pride and Violence of the baſeſt of men. And that it was a wrath directed againſt us was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, becauſe the misfortunes and fall of that Incomparable <hi>Prince</hi> opened upon us an ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for all thoſe miſeries that a Community is obnoxious unto in the want of a lawful Government, while the Almighty ſecured the Glory of the <hi>King</hi> even in His Sufferings, provided for the Support and Honour of the Royal Family in its loweſt Eſtate, and miraculouſly preſerved the Chief of it from innumerable dangers, and made us to ſee afterwards in the Series of his Providences, that he had not withdrawn his loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Houſe of <hi>King CHARLES,</hi> by reſtoring it to its primitive Grandeur.</p>
            <pb n="280" facs="tcp:35342:147"/>
            <p> And this he was pleaſed to ſignifie to the <hi>King</hi> by a Paſſage that appeared little leſs than a Miracle. For while He was at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> now Lord High-Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> (a Perſon of unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Honour and Veracity,<note place="margin">A Preſage of His Fall, and the future State of the Royal Family.</note> of an eminent Integrity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Flattery of Princes, who doth atteſt this Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) as Gentleman of the Bed-chamber lay one Night in the ſame Chamber with Him, the Wax <hi>Mortar,</hi> which according to Cuſtom the <hi>King</hi> always had in His Chamber, was in the night, as they both conceived and took notice of it, fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. But my Lord riſing in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found it lighted, and ſaid to the <hi>KING, Sir, this Mortar now burns very clearly:</hi> at which they both exceedingly wondred, as fully concluding it had been out in the Night, and they could not imagine how any of the Grooms, or any other could poſſibly light it, the Door being locked with a Spring within. This buſying the wonder of both for the preſent, the <hi>King</hi> afterwards when He ſaw the Malice of His Enemies preſs hard upon His Life and Ruine, reflecting upon this Occurrence, drew it into this Preſage, <hi>That though God would permit His Light to be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:35342:147"/>extinguiſhed for a time, yet He would at laſt light it again;</hi> which was verified in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: for though God ſuffered the Faction to ſpill His blood, yet after many years of Troubles, and when he had permitted thoſe Monſters to bring us to the brinks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, he reſtored His Son to the Crown in as much Splendour and Greatneſs as any of His Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>As His Abilities for the Publick Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government were all apt to raiſe Admiration;<note place="margin">His Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> ſo His Recreations and Privacies gave a Delight to ſuch as commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in the ſight of them, and there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more to beget an Honour of Him than to behold Him in His Diverſions, which were all ſerious, and there was no part of His time which either wanted benefit, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not Commendation. In His younger dayes, His pleaſures were in Riding, and ſometimes in breaking the great Horſe; and He did it ſo gracefully, that He deſerved that Statue of Braſs which did repreſent Him on Horſe-back. Beſides this, He delighted in Hunting, an active and ſtirring Exerciſe to accuſtom Him to toils, and harden that body whoſe mind abhorred the ſoftneſs of <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Eaſe,</hi> which <hi>Vicious Princes think a part of Power, and the Rewards of Publick Cares:</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:35342:148"/>but He uſed this as the way whereby the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Heroes were habituated to Labours, and by contending with ſome beaſts in Strength and others in Swiftneſs, firſt to rout, then to chaſe their flying Enemies. When the ſeaſon of the year did not permit this ſport, then Tennis, Gough, Bowls were the ways of His Diverſions, and in all theſe He was wonderfully active and excellent.</p>
            <p>His ſofter pleaſures were Books, and of His time ſpent in theſe there were many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents. In His Library at Saint <hi>James</hi>'s there was kept a Collection of His, of the excellent Sayings of Authors, written with His own hand, and in his Youth, preſented to His Father <hi>King JAMES:</hi> and there is yet extant in the hands of a Worthy Perſon, His Extracts written with His own hand, out of My Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Book againſt <hi>Fiſher,</hi> of all the Arguments againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, digeſted into ſo excellent a Method, that He gave Light and Strength to them even while He did epitomiſe them into a ſheet or two of Paper. The ſame Care and Pains He had beſtowed in reading the moſt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Hooker,</hi> and the Learned Works of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> out of all which He had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered whatſoever was excellent in them, and fitted them for His ready uſe. When He was tired with Reading, then He applyed Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:35342:148"/>to Diſcourſe, wherein He both benefited Himſelf and others; and He was good at the Relation of a Story, or telling of an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. When theſe were tedious by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, He would either play at Cheſs, or pleaſe Himſelf with His Pictures, of which He had many choice pieces of the beſt Maſters, as <hi>Titian, Rafael, Tintoret</hi> and others, with which He had adorned His moſt frequented Palaces, as alſo with moſt antique pieces of Sculpture; ſo that to thoſe that had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it ſeemed that <hi>Italy</hi> was Tranſlated to His Court.</p>
            <p>As His Spirit was thus accompliſhed, ſo His Body had its Elegancies. His Stature was of a juſt height,<note place="margin">The Features of His Body.</note> rather decent than tall; His Body erect, and not enclining to a Corpulency, nor meager, till His Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions wrought too ſtrongly upon it to a Leanneſs; His Limbs exactly proportioned, His Face full of Majeſty, and His Brow large and Fair: His Eyes ſo quick and piercing, that they went farther than the Superficies of men, and ſearched their more Inward parts; for at the firſt ſight He would paſs a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the frame of a Man's Spirit and Faculties, and He was not often miſtaken, having a ſtrange happineſs in Phyſiognomy, and by reaſon of this He would remember
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:35342:149"/>any one He had ſeen but once many years after. His Complexion was enclining to a Paleneſs, His Hair a brown, which He wore of a moderate length, ending in gentle and eaſie curles: upon His left ſide He indulged one Lock to a greater length in the youthful part of His Life. His Beard He wore pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, but after the Faction had paſſed thoſe <hi>Votes of No Addreſſes,</hi> He permitted it to grow neglectedly, and to cover more of His face. His Geſtures had nothing of affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but full of Majeſtick Gravity. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſpeedy, and His gate faſt: which ſhewed the Alacrity and Vigour of His Mind, for His Affections were temperate. He was of a moſt healthful Conſtitution, and after the infirmities of His Childhood was never ſick. Once He had the ſmall Pox, but the Malignity of it was ſo ſmall, that it altered not His Stomach, nor put Him to the abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of one Meal, neither did it detain Him above a fortnight under the Care of His Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</p>
            <p>He was the Father of Four Sons and Five Daughters.<note place="margin">His Children.</note>
